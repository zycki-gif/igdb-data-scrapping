These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many \"Crash Dollars\" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as \"traffic checking\", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a \"checked\" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.\nDuring these events, players have access to a limited amount of boost which is acquired through various dangerous driving techniques, including but not limited to driving on the wrong side of the road, tailgating opponents and drifting. Unique to the series is the concept of battling other rivals; unlike other video games in the racing genre, players are encouraged, and sometimes even required, to ram rival cars and cause traffic to crash. Causing a rival to crash is referred to as a \"Takedown\", rewarding the player by extending the length of their boost gauge and completely refilling it. In designated events, boost can also be used to activate a \"Crashbreaker\" during a crash, detonating the car and causing other nearby cars to crash. When the rival car takes the player down, the player will have to take the ultimate REVENGE by taking down the revenge rivals (which the arrow at the top of the car turned red) is referred to as \"Revenge Takedown\".\nIn the main single-player game mode, players compete in a world tour consisting of 169 events across three continents, divided into a series of 11 \"ranks\" (Rank 11 has no events). The ranks which a player has access to is determined by their \"Revenge Rank\", which increases after completing events. By increasing their Rank sufficiently, the player \"ranks up\" and unlocks the next rank of events.\nThere are 77 cars in the game, some of which can only be used for crash events. The SUVs and saloon cars are some of them.\nThe game also features support for multiplayer gameplay, both online and offline. In addition to the racing modes, the game features three types of Crash modes: Crash Battle (multiple players attempt a junction at the same time), Crash Party (players take turns at attempting junctions across several rounds), and Crash Tour (a golf-like version of Crash Party, with players attempting to accumulate a certain amount of Crash Dollars in as few attempts as possible; after the last round ends the player with the lowest score wins).\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of Burnout Revenge includes several new features and improves the graphics of the game to utilize the power of the next-gen console. The game includes 10 new crash junctions on the Crash Tour. It also includes a vastly improved online mode that introduces online Revenge Rivals. This system allows players to keep track of their number of times they have been taken out or have taken out any given player.\nThe new version also includes a new Burnout Clips feature, which allows to save 30 second clips of any offline race played and can be shared with other players over Xbox Live.", "tags": [1, 268435466, 536870937, 536871313, 536871314, 536871647, 536872205, 536872221, 536872245, 536872352, 536872415, 536872587, 536872590, 536873053, 536873064, 536873274, 536873390, 536874539, 536874743, 536875122, 536875133, 536875194, 536875271, 536875364, 536875456, 536875490, 536875715, 536875781, 536875802, 536876199, 536876214, 536876435, 536876695, 536876762, 536876821, 536876948, 536877744, 536877938, 536877982, 536879193, 536880134, 536880272, 536880441, 536880839, 536880840, 536881347, 536882450, 536883074, 536883943, 536884021, 536885957, 536885958, 536886215], "themes": [1], "total_rating": 84.56612471824519, "total_rating_count": 85, "updated_at": 1688926156, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/burnout-revenge", "videos": [13177, 13178], "websites": [20597, 20598, 20599, 342892], "checksum": "8ff8319d-0766-f0a2-2fff-401964e6d55d", "game_localizations": [1365]}, {"id": 5327, "age_ratings": [7772, 33124, 67884, 98446, 98447, 98448, 136120], "aggregated_rating": 52.35, "aggregated_rating_count": 25, "alternative_names": [50479], "artworks": [4624, 4625], "category": 0, "collection": 3687, "cover": 117000, "created_at": 1392095117, "expansions": [169525], "external_games": [10601, 57002, 80892, 80894, 80896, 87182, 97600, 97601, 97602, 97603, 97604, 117202, 210700, 218925, 218926, 245453, 400208, 400209, 1237186, 2086632, 2125286, 2135229, 2161402, 2173262, 2439155, 2450179, 2584083, 2587878, 2594607, 2638626, 2699715], "first_release_date": 1466467200, "follows": 24, "game_engines": [351], "game_modes": [1, 2, 3, 4], "genres": [5, 8, 31, 33], "hypes": 17, "involved_companies": [12885, 12886, 29395, 29396], "keywords": [126, 166, 426, 588, 904, 1033, 1059, 1158, 1293, 1375, 1494, 3898, 4004, 4134, 4287, 4344, 4347, 4378, 4609, 4836, 4940, 4957, 5441, 6200, 7292, 7309, 17215, 23933], "multiplayer_modes": [8158], "name": "Mighty No. 9", "platforms": [3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 37, 41, 46, 48, 49], "player_perspectives": [4], "rating": 57.32429888472361, "rating_count": 37, "release_dates": [45883, 45884, 50309, 50310, 50311, 50312, 50313, 50314, 50315, 50316, 133882, 133883, 136148, 141406, 141407], "screenshots": [25586, 25587, 25588, 25589, 25590, 165737, 165738, 165739, 165740, 165741, 165742, 165743], "similar_games": [3222, 7350, 9806, 11646, 14593, 16992, 32969, 36198, 55190, 56033], "slug": "mighty-no-9", "storyline": "\"In the year 20XX ---- breakthroughs in robotic technology have ushered in a new era of peace & prosperity.\n\nViolence is confined to the Battle Coliseum, where robot combatants face off in spectacular duels.\n\nDr. White created 9 robot siblings known as the \u201cMighty Numbers\u201d, who were the most popular and powerful team of robots in the Battle Coliseum and always in the top ranks.\n\nBut, during one competition there was a cyber attack, infecting them with a computer virus causing them to become crazed and rampant.\"", "summary": "Mighty No. 9 is focused on 2D platforming with a blend of 2D and 3D artwork and animation.

After a few successful bouts, he and his trainer Gus Carisi are approached by DL McQueen, famed fight promoter and longtime foe of Carisi who offers to promote Andre under the management of his daughter Meagan. The two refuse, causing a dispute between the crooked promoter and Bishop. McQueen continues to urge Andre to sign a deal with him, only to be denied each time. He soon frames Andre of police assault with the help of two crooked cops. Andre is then sentenced to over 5 years in prison.\n\nAfter a series of fights inside of jail Andre is framed and ambushed in the showers where he gets a rough beating. Soon after recovering from his injuries, Andre begins to train himself and keep fit while imprisoned. He is angered to discover that his brother Raymond had become a professional heavyweight with McQueen Promotions, the company that framed him. Soon after being released, Raymond organizes him a job as an assistant trainer. Now a heavyweight and a focused fighter, Andre beats two ranked heavyweights during regular sparring sessions. Meagan approaches him soon after and offers to get him a new professional license, having split from her father's business due to disagreements. Gus returns as Andre's trainer and helps him make an unexpected comeback as a heavyweight.\n\nFollowing several successful heavyweight bouts, Andre's brother Raymond challenges him to a fight to secure a chance against the world heavyweight champion Isaac Frost. During the fight, Andre goes down but does not get up to allow his brother a chance at the title. Raymond then fights Frost, and is defeated in the first round by a devastating KO.

But when they attempt to rob a bank with actor Josh Birk, who is to play a Saint's member, their everyday routine takes an unlikely turn when the bank tellers unexpectedly start an all out gun war on the saints. The Saints attempt to airlift the vault out of the building, but when Birk foolishly sets off the alarm, it alerts the Stilwater P.D. and, after a large-scale firefight with police and S.W.A.T, the Saints are incarcerated.\nIn jail, Saints second-in-command Johnny Gat laments what the Saints have become, expressing disappointment at having strayed from their roots. At that point, an international criminal organization, called The Syndicate, bribes the police to release the Boss, Gat, and Shaundi. The three are forcibly taken to the Syndicate's leader Phillipe Loren, to try and negotiate a business plan with them aboard Loren's private jet. While in-flight, Loren tells them they will be allowed to live if they turn over 2/3 of the Saints' business in Stilwater. The Boss and Gat immediately reject this offer, and are able to fight their way out, with Gat commanding the plane back to Stilwater. The Boss and Shaundi use a parachute to escape the plane, but Gat is believed to be killed in the process.\nUpon landing, the Boss and Shaundi find themselves in Steelport, the dystopian criminal city controlled by the Syndicate, a group of three gangs: The Morning Star, a gang with advanced technology equipment, controlled by Loren himself, the Luchadores, a Mexican gang lead by the killer wrestler Killbane, and the Deckers, a hacker-based gang led by Matt Miller. After calling Pierce Washington, the Boss's second-in-command, to Steelport, the Saints seize a Morning Star penthouse for their new headquarters, hijack a UAV from a military base, and begin attacking Morning Star's businesses, culminating with an attack on Syndicate Tower, Loren's headquarters, in which the Saints rescue Oleg Kirlov, an apparent superhuman and template for the Syndicate's Brute clones, and Loren is killed. When the Saints try to transport Gat's body to Stilwater for his funeral, Killbane, now leader of the Syndicate, leads an attack on them. The fight destroys Stilwater's Hughes Memorial Bridge in the process.\nTo retaliate, the player seeks out anti-Syndicate talent, recruiting Oleg as an enforcer, ex-FBI hacker Kinzie Kensington as an informant; Zimos, the oldest pimp in Steelport; and Angel de la Muerte, Killbane's vengeful former tag-team partner. They are later joined by Viola DeWynter after Killbane kills her twin sister Kiki out of rage due to a failed assassination attempt on the Boss. Her defection, however, coincides with the arrival of the paramilitary S.T.A.G. (Special Tactical Anti-Gang) forces in Steelport, created by Senator Monica Hughes after the destruction of the bridge to end gang violence once and for all. The Saints take on STAG regardless, resulting in Steelport going under martial law, whilst also dealing with the Syndicate.\nAfter providing Kinzie with the appropriate technology, the player enters the Deckers mainframe, defeating Deckers leader Matt Miller's avatar in a virtual reality fight and driving him and most of the Deckers out of town. At Angel's insistence, the player opts to take on Killbane by killing the other contestants in his Murderbrawl XXXI pay-per-view to gain entrance, and then, with Angel's help, defeating Killbane in Murderbrawl with the option to unmask or spare him. Following his humiliating defeat, an enraged Killbane responds by instigating several attacks on the Saints and STAG throughout Steelport to cause chaos.\nWhilst quelling the fighting between the Luchadores and STAG, the Boss is simultaneously informed that Killbane is escaping the city while STAG second-in-command Kia is holding Shaundi, Viola, and Mayor Burt Reynolds hostage at a Steelport monument rigged to blow to frame the Saints. The Boss kills Kia and saves Shaundi and the others, the Saints are hailed as heroes for saving the monument and STAG pulls out of Steelport with the threat that they will be back. The Boss tracks Killbane down to Mars and kill him in what is ultimately revealed to be a scene from the Saints sci-fi film Gangstas in Space, which the Boss and several members are acting in.\nAn alternate, non-canonical ending plays out should the player opt to eliminate Killbane. In which the destruction of the monument is used as a pretext by STAG to attack Steelport with the airborne aircraft carrier Daedalus. The Boss destroys the Daedalus, killing STAG leader Cyrus Temple in the process, and declares Steelport an independent city-state under the Saints' control, with Pierce taking charge as mayor, and the Boss as the ultimate leader.", "summary": "Saints Row: The Third is the first Saints Row game that takes place in the city of Steelport. Much like the first two games, the story revolves around the Saints destroying and absorbing three rival gangs, taking over the city in the process. In Saints Row: The Third, these three gangs are the Morningstar, the Luchadores, and the Deckers. Unlike the first two games, these three gangs are all controlled by a criminal organization known as The Syndicate, which the saints must also deal with.", "tags": [1, 27, 33, 38, 268435461, 268435466, 268435487, 536870917, 536870933, 536870937, 536871041, 536871067, 536871094, 536871133, 536871134, 536871186, 536871196, 536871313, 536871525, 536871615, 536871618, 536871801, 536871889, 536872070, 536872100, 536872205, 536872225, 536872315, 536872352, 536872371, 536872581, 536872587, 536872590, 536872626, 536872883, 536872914, 536873010, 536873455, 536874552, 536874743, 536874916, 536875047, 536875057, 536875062, 536875091, 536875157, 536875162, 536875183, 536875184, 536875185, 536875199, 536875257, 536875271, 536875300, 536875310, 536875315, 536875322, 536875364, 536875396, 536875432, 536875453, 536875490, 536875521, 536875525, 536875527, 536875559, 536875593, 536875623, 536875638, 536875642, 536875682, 536875688, 536875689, 536875693, 536875735, 536875764, 536875766, 536875781, 536875802, 536875803, 536875830, 536875868, 536875896, 536875904, 536875937, 536876062, 536876063, 536876070, 536876126, 536876190, 536876220, 536876289, 536876298, 536876330, 536876383, 536876386, 536876429, 536876476, 536876505, 536876545, 536876552, 536876569, 536876643, 536876695, 536876726, 536876762, 536876817, 536876821, 536876823, 536876853, 536876901, 536876934, 536876978, 536876987, 536877000, 536877109, 536877158, 536877207, 536877295, 536877398, 536877405, 536877628, 536877642, 536877664, 536877744, 536878009, 536878026, 536878227, 536878247, 536879062, 536879084, 536879184, 536879740, 536879957, 536879978, 536880223, 536880863, 536880864, 536881653, 536882120, 536882386, 536882508, 536882806, 536882954, 536883374, 536889479], "themes": [1, 27, 33, 38], "total_rating": 81.46421510980014, "total_rating_count": 560, "updated_at": 1688925979, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/saints-row-the-third", "videos": [32415, 32416], "websites": [18777, 18778, 18779, 181307, 332685], "checksum": "14bdf7ef-3dfd-9659-1710-228729e56bf9", "remasters": [132097], "language_supports": [240727, 240728, 240729, 240730, 240731, 240732, 240733, 240734, 240735, 240736], "game_localizations": [3038, 19234]}, {"id": 249478, "age_ratings": [138079, 138094, 138095, 138096, 138097, 138098], "artworks": [107806], "category": 0, "cover": 302444, "created_at": 1683848457, "external_games": [2702613, 2702641, 2702969, 2708270], "first_release_date": 1683763200, "game_modes": [1], "genres": [8], "name": "After You: Level Escape", "platforms": [49, 169], "release_dates": [474892, 474893], "screenshots": [1049773, 1049777, 1049779, 1049780, 1049781, 1049782], "slug": "after-you-level-escape", "summary": "\"After You: Level Escape\" is a narrative game with puzzles, but it is not an easy game, here you will not have indicators or tutorials, nor can you save when you want.

Abstergo intends to put Desmond in the device to recall the memories of his ancestor, Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad, a member of the Assassin Brotherhood in the year 1191, who lived during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land. Initially, Desmond has trouble adjusting to the device, but eventually relives Alta\u00efr's exploits over the next several days. The game then primarily changes to Alta\u00efr's point-of-view, with occasional transitions to Desmond, due to problems with the Animus or onset of the Bleeding Effect.\n\nThe game opens with Desmond entering Alta\u00efr's memory, but he soon faces synchronization problems. On this, Lucy Stillman and Warren Vidic's voices can be heard, arguing over Desmond's safety within the Animus. After experiencing a few problems, Desmond exits the virtual machine and Vidic briefs him about the Animus' inner workings, before initializing the machine's tutorial program. After Desmond is done with the tutorial, he enters the closest synchronizable memory of Alta\u00efr; Lucy adds that Desmond has to relive key moments of Alta\u00efr's life to increase his synchronization, before reaching the final memory which holds the information that Abstergo is seeking.\n\nAlta\u00efr is first shown attempting to retrieve one of a series of artifacts known as the \"Pieces of Eden\" from Solomon's Temple with the help of Malik Al-Sayf, and his brother Kadar, but they are stopped by Robert de Sabl\u00e9, Grand Master of the Knights Templar and sworn enemy of the Assassins. While retrieving the treasure, Alta\u00efr breaks all three tenets of the Assassins' Creed in an attempt to kill Robert, but he ultimately fails. In the following commotion, Malik's brother is killed, and Malik's left arm is crippled and later amputated. When Alta\u00efr returns to the Assassins' stronghold at Masyaf with apologies, Malik, who survived de Sabl\u00e9, comes back with the artifact and disparages Alta\u00efr because of his arrogance.\n\nAfter narrowly defeating a retaliatory attack by the Templars, Al Mualim, leader of the Assassins, demotes Alta\u00efr to a novice but gives him another chance to rise through the ranks of the Brotherhood. Al Mualim assigns Alta\u00efr the task of assassinating nine key figures across the Holy Land in Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus, aiming to bring peace between the Crusader and Saracen forces. Each target is based on an actual historical figure from the Third Crusade, including Majd Addin, Garnier de Naplouse, Jubair al Hakim, Abu'l Nuqoud, Sibrand, William of Montferrat, and Robert de Sabl\u00e9.\n\nAlta\u00efr completes each task, learning how each target is connected to Robert and the Templars and how together they aim to end the Crusades and place the Holy Land under their own control. With men on both sides killed, he discovers that Robert's last plot is to attempt to unite the Christian and Muslim forces against their new common enemy, the Assassins themselves. Alta\u00efr defeats de Sabl\u00e9 before Richard the Lionheart, failing to convince the King that an end to the war would be welcome to both sides, but ending Robert's plot. From de Sabl\u00e9, Alta\u00efr discovers that Al Mualim was himself a member of the Templars and used the Assassin to kill the other members who held the secret to the treasure's power, so that he could selfishly keep the artifact for himself.\n\nAlta\u00efr quickly returns to Masyaf and approaches his master, who reveals the truth to him: the Piece of Eden, which he had recovered through the help of Alta\u00efr directly before his transgression, creates illusions. He denounces religion and other seemingly supernatural events (e.g. the Ten Plagues of Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the presence of the Greek Gods in the Trojan War) as illusions caused by the Piece, and then states his intention to use the artifact to compel mankind into a brainwashed state, and in doing so, bringing an end to all conflict; Alta\u00efr is eventually able to see through the deceptions created by the artifact to kill Al Mualim. When Alta\u00efr recovers the artifact, the Piece of Eden activates, showing a holographic view of the world with numerous locations of other Pieces of Eden marked across the globe.\n\nWhen the process is complete, Desmond learns that Abstergo is a modern-day front of the Templars, and they are already seeking other artifacts at locations identified in Alta\u00efr's memories. Further, he learns that the modern-day Assassins had tried to rescue him before the memory had completed but had failed. Following this, Desmond was to be killed after an order from a high-ranking Templar, Alan Rikkin, but Lucy Stillman saves him from death and, at one point, tucks her ring finger into her palm, referring to the Assassins' tradition of cutting off the finger.\n\nThough Desmond remains trapped in the Abstergo laboratory, his experience in the Animus has created a Bleeding Effect of Alta\u00efr's life in his own, allowing Desmond to use Alta\u00efr's Eagle Vision, which, in turn, allows him to see strange messages painted on the walls of his room and the floor of the lab. The messages all deal with various forms of the end of the world from different cultures, including several references to 21 December 2012, the date that Abstergo plans to launch a satellite that will \"permanently end the war.\" It is hinted that this method would be by the same method that Al Mualim hypnotized Masyaf, only on a larger scale. Finally, the game ends with Desmond wondering what the images all mean and who could have drawn them.", "summary": "Assassin's Creed is a non-linear action-adventure video game, during which the player controls a 12th-century Levantine Assassin named Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad during the Third Crusade, whose life is experienced through the Animus by his 21st century descendant, Desmond Miles.", "tags": [1, 17, 18, 22, 23, 33, 38, 268435464, 268435487, 536870934, 536871044, 536871063, 536871082, 536871133, 536871195, 536871302, 536871535, 536871945, 536872130, 536872211, 536872315, 536872371, 536872550, 536872626, 536873192, 536873328, 536874345, 536875046, 536875257, 536875269, 536875830, 536875831, 536875910, 536876220, 536876235, 536876241, 536876309, 536876392, 536876487, 536876545, 536876911, 536877125, 536878264, 536878512, 536879069, 536879082, 536879212, 536879739, 536880430, 536888127], "themes": [1, 17, 18, 22, 23, 33, 38], "total_rating": 77.16995871580195, "total_rating_count": 1412, "updated_at": 1688925912, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/assassin-s-creed", "videos": [12426], "websites": [13724, 13725, 13727, 13728, 56796, 106858, 131521, 131522, 287301, 333911], "checksum": "6b8a7bfa-199c-53b4-64ee-23813024012c", "expanded_games": [27827], "ports": [68526], "language_supports": [305223, 305224, 305225, 305226, 305227], "game_localizations": [19155]}, {"id": 250118, "age_ratings": [138814, 138815, 138816, 138817, 138818, 138819], "artworks": [108190], "category": 0, "cover": 303361, "created_at": 1684369058, "external_games": [2704570, 2704581, 2704719, 2707986], "first_release_date": 1684281600, "game_modes": [1], "name": "Puzzle by Nikoli W Numberlink", "platforms": [49], "release_dates": [475916], "screenshots": [1054117, 1054118, 1054119, 1054120, 1054121, 1054122], "slug": "puzzle-by-nikoli-w-numberlink", "summary": "Numberlink is a puzzle where you connect the same numbers without crossing lines.

One of the player's teammates from that mission, Sam Watts, sends a pre-recorded video message to the player, where he reveals that he is likely dead, and that his final wish is that the player find whomever killed him. He also announces that he has 100,000 nuyen being held in escrow for the player should he bring whomever was responsible for his death to justice. Knowing that Sam resides in Seattle, the player travels to the city to begin their investigation.\nUpon arriving in Seattle and visiting the morgue where Sam's body is being examined, the player discovers that Sam is the latest victim of the Emerald City Ripper, a serial killer who has been surgically removing organs from his or her victims. The Runner soon enlists the help of one of Sam's friends to help find the killer; Jake Armitage, returning from the SNES Shadowrun game. Jake soon leaves the party as he is being hunted by multiple gangs and corporations over an unrelated shadowrun and must go into hiding, but he points the player to the scene of the crime, and to further leads that could help break the case open. Soon afterwards, the player meets Coyote, a female elf bartender/shadowrunner who is waging a private war against \"Better-Than-Life\" (\"BTL\") chips and those who trade them. She was a friend of Sam's as well; together they follow the Ripper as he commits more murders across Seattle. During their investigation they assist the more cooperative police officers assigned to the case, as well as the friends and family of the Ripper's victims (including Sam's sister, Jessica Watts), as they attempt to find and identify the Ripper.\nTheir pursuit eventually leads them to Mercy Mental Hospital, where they find that a male elf named Silas Forsberg has taken the identity of the original administrator. Silas has been using the facility as a front for his organ harvesting operation; not only in his role as the Ripper, but also for financial gain (both by selling organs from unrelated victims to street clinics, and by brainwashing particular inmates at the hospital and then selling them as sex slaves). After killing Silas, the player learns he was directed to commit the Ripper murders by another party. They quickly determine that Jessica Watts commissioned Silas to commit the crimes, based partially on an earlier admission that she had been estranged from her brother. Sam and Jessica had lived a comfortable life before their father's passing, and despite his best efforts early on to live a decent life, he cracked under the pressure and spent the family savings on drugs and alcohol. He eventually became a shadowrunner to make ends meet, and to further fuel his self-destructive habits.\nWhen the player confronts Jessica at Sam's funeral Jessica reveals she had indeed ordered her brother's death, and the deaths of the other Ripper victims so her mother could have a proper funeral. She subsequently snaps and orders her bodyguards to kill the player, Armitage (who has briefly come out of hiding to pay his respects) and Coyote. The bodyguards fail, but she and a mysterious elf woman escape. While going over the dead bodies, the party discovers that Jessica is a member of the Universal Brotherhood, which is well known as an international new age spiritualism organization that attracts rich and poor alike. They also discover that the elf at the funeral was Lynne Telestrian; not only is she a high-ranking Brotherhood member, but her family manages Telestrian Industries. Between the corporation and to a lesser extent the Brotherhood, and she and the rest of her kin are extremely wealthy and influential. Armitage, not wanting to get himself in further trouble with the powers that be, goes back into hiding after discovering this.\nThe player and Coyote track Jessica to the Brotherhood chapter near Pike's Market. While Coyote waits outside, the player cases the building and discovers that the Brotherhood are very heavily armed and have been involved in the disappearances of several individuals. Letting Coyote into the building via the service entrance, they break into the \"inner sanctum\" of the facility and discover that the Universal Brotherhood is itself a front for an insect spirit hive. The runners also meet Jessica again, who is says she is quite aware of the Brotherhood's true nature. The team rescues a young elf woman before escaping the facility, finding that they are unable to kill the these exotic spirits with their current weapons.\nThe woman however connects the team with her boyfriend, a decker named Baron Samedi. Under his directions, the team infiltrates Telestrian Industries, as they were working on Project Aegis; a chemical weapon capable of killing spirits easily. The operation is not successful, however, and the player is forced to infiltrate the company a second time alone in order to retrieve the only sample of the Aegis compound. The player acquires the sample but is captured while trying to escape. Given the importance and secrecy assigned to Aegis, the player is brought before the owner of the company, James Telestrian.\nHere the player learns the truth behind Sam Watts and his sister; that they were both half breed children of the Telestrian bloodline, the product an affair between James' father and Sam's mother. To prevent the truth of the affair from becoming public knowledge, the senior Telestrian paid Sam's mother handsomely and they \"officially\" became the offspring of James Watts, another employee at Telestrian Industries. This is important as the young woman who the player rescued from the Brotherhood is actually James' daughter. Jessica, who is also revealed to be the insect shaman of the hive, had become aware of the connection and was going to use the close familial connection help aid her in bridging over a Queen insect spirit into the real world. Also at the mansion is the immortal elf Harlequin, who discusses how insect spirits need to inhabit bodies of sapient life forms to exist in the material world, and also states that the existence of a Queen in the real world be disastrous. Volunteering to help destroy the hive, Harlequin joins the player and his team a the final raid on the Brotherhood chapter. Telestrian gives the player, and Harlequin, each a shotgun able to fire capsules filled with the Aegis compound. Before they leave, the player also discovers that Lynne Telestrian is as fully committed to the hive as Jessica, if not more so. Her loyalty to the Brotherhood led her to blow up the Telestrian Industries factory producing Aegis recently, not only estranging her from James but also leaving the sample and the prototype weapons the only articles remaining from the project.\nThe team infiltrates the hive and they fight their way into the heart of the inner sanctum. There they discover Jessica and Lynne Telestrian in a magical circle; since James' daughter was taken out of their reach and thus can no longer become the host for the Queen, Lynne has volunteered herself to be the host and they are in the process of completing the ritual. The team disrupts the summoning by seriously wounding Jessica and killing most of the insect spirits inside the hive, a feat made possible due to the Aegis weapons. The queen spirit abandons Jessica, and the player is given the option to kill her or arrest her. Lynne survives, but is arrested and eventually sent to a mental hospital.\nThe game concludes with Armitage, Coyote, Harlequin and James Telestrian discussing the fallout of the raid, with Harlequin musing that other Brotherhood chapters across the world also hold hives similar to the one in Seattle. Having satisfactorily solved the circumstances of Sam's death, the player attempts to collect the money he left. Sam's second message congratulating the player asks him to apologize to Jessica for what he put her through, and that he never actually had any money in escrow, and suggests the player ask the people he and his family knew for a reward of some kind, which the player does at a 1,5 million Nuyen payment, garnished after the assault on Telestrian industries to a mere 15,000 Nuyen payout. The player could also ask for the same money Sam promised, a position as Security VP (making them a company man for Telestrian), the resignation of a particular officer or preserving Touristville.\nIn the epilogue following Sam's last message, the game reveals that Aegis was eventually developed into a product called \"Fluorescing Astral Bacteria-3\", or \"FAB-3\". As per the history of the pen-and-paper game Shadowrun Returns is based on, the destruction of the Chicago Universal Brotherhood hive is botched and the city is largely sealed up behind a wall to keep the rampaging insect spirits inside the city. FAB-3 is used some time later to cleanse Chicago of its insect spirit infestation.\n\n- Credits: Wikipedia", "summary": "The year is 2054.

Behind every game are the stories of Atari, what was happening at the company, what went into the creation of the games and the hardware on which they ran, all told by the people who were there. It is a rare opportunity to get a rich behind-the-scenes look at the history of video games.\n\nIn addition to presenting these Atari classics exactly as they were, the talented team at Digital Eclipse has also created the Reimagined series\u2014six new games that revisit, mash-up and reimagine Atari Classics. Each of these new games is included in Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.", "tags": [1, 22, 268435461, 268435464, 268435481, 268435489], "themes": [1, 22], "total_rating": 83.0, "total_rating_count": 5, "updated_at": 1688922748, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration", "videos": [77836, 77854], "websites": [294263, 313529, 324145], "checksum": "3e9acb96-85d0-dc82-1b1a-9533786f8fbe", "language_supports": [135763, 135764, 135765, 135767, 135769, 135771, 207349, 250674, 250675, 250676, 250677, 250678, 250679]}, {"id": 11328, "age_ratings": [48243, 109207, 109208, 126601, 126602], "aggregated_rating": 85.0, "aggregated_rating_count": 7, "alternative_names": [46161, 96033], "artworks": [47174], "category": 0, "cover": 98569, "created_at": 1436478625, "external_games": [25471, 132855, 190167, 246246, 1303100, 2082912, 2161939, 2589003, 2692557], "first_release_date": 1250640000, "follows": 21, "game_engines": [6], "game_modes": [1], "genres": [5, 8, 9, 31], "involved_companies": [102370, 102371, 102372], "keywords": [21, 72, 167, 477, 558, 589, 966, 1033, 1059, 1186, 1293, 1638, 2155, 2324, 3203, 3486, 3831, 3931, 4134, 4179, 4239, 4284, 4285, 4287, 4331, 4333, 4359, 4396, 4397, 4403, 4410, 4484, 4578, 4637, 4711, 4770, 4891, 4903, 4940, 4984, 4991, 4992, 5000, 5029, 5106, 5150, 5209, 5210, 5302, 5308, 5441, 5447, 5449, 5466, 5535, 5633, 5640, 5738, 5812, 5840, 5962, 5963, 5998, 6007, 6083, 6461, 6539, 6620, 6621, 6648, 6692, 6863, 7092, 8802, 11533, 12953, 13036, 13137, 13209, 23933], "name": "Shadow Complex", "platforms": [6, 12, 48, 49], "player_perspectives": [4], "rating": 85.74556927228264, "rating_count": 42, "release_dates": [50240, 50241, 50242, 353030], "screenshots": [10988, 10989, 10990, 23104, 23105], "similar_games": [533, 571, 1006, 1164, 2031, 9498, 9727, 11118, 19441, 19531], "slug": "shadow-complex", "summary": "Shadow Complex is presented in 2.5D format; the game world is fully three-dimensional, but the player can only move in two dimensions, simulating the environment of a classic side-scrolling video game. Enemies can, however, move in any direction, and auto-aim is utilized to allow the player to fire at nearby enemies or objects both inside and outside of the 2D plane. The player can use the right control stick to aim with a laser sight. Gameplay in Shadow Complex was inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The gameplay takes many cues from Metroid: the player can move freely throughout the expansive game world, defeating enemies with a variety of weapons, and as they overcome challenges, they gain new abilities and weapons which allow them to reach new areas.\nThe game rewards the player with experience points as they complete objectives and defeat enemies. The player can gain experience levels, each level boosting basic attributes of the character. These experience levels grant the player skills such as improved gunfire precision or damage resistance. Special rewards such as revealing the full map and unlimited special ammo are granted at specific levels. When the player starts a new game, they will lose all the weapons and items that they have acquired, but will keep the character's experience level and any benefits they have already received from that experience.\nIn addition to the main campaign, a number of challenge levels, called \"Proving Grounds\", are available, generally requiring the player to make it to the exit of a room using a limited set of items and health. Players are ranked based on time of completion and any scoring objectives when they complete the level. Scores and other statistics from the main campaign and the training group are tracked via online leaderboards.\nA remastered version and port was announced during the 215 Game Awards, to be released for PS4, Xbox One, PC.", "tags": [1, 18, 39, 268435461, 268435464, 268435465, 268435487, 536870933, 536870984, 536871079, 536871389, 536871470, 536871501, 536871878, 536871945, 536871971, 536872098, 536872205, 536872550, 536873067, 536873236, 536874115, 536874398, 536874743, 536874843, 536875046, 536875091, 536875151, 536875196, 536875197, 536875199, 536875243, 536875245, 536875271, 536875308, 536875309, 536875315, 536875322, 536875396, 536875490, 536875549, 536875623, 536875682, 536875803, 536875815, 536875852, 536875896, 536875903, 536875904, 536875912, 536875941, 536876018, 536876062, 536876121, 536876122, 536876214, 536876220, 536876353, 536876359, 536876361, 536876378, 536876447, 536876545, 536876552, 536876650, 536876724, 536876752, 536876874, 536876875, 536876910, 536876919, 536876995, 536877373, 536877451, 536877532, 536877533, 536877560, 536877604, 536877775, 536878004, 536879714, 536882445, 536883865, 536883948, 536884049, 536884121, 536894845], "themes": [1, 18, 39], "total_rating": 85.37278463614132, "total_rating_count": 49, "updated_at": 1688922742, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-complex", "videos": [6351], "websites": [5356, 172689, 333475], "checksum": "9d26d0b4-ddd6-0ea3-efff-1c023cdaab17", "remasters": [19009], "game_localizations": [19594]}, {"id": 509, "age_ratings": [159, 44867, 68996, 108051, 126398], "aggregated_rating": 80.8, "aggregated_rating_count": 14, "alternative_names": [38132, 128116], "artworks": [3963, 3964, 3965, 3966, 3967, 3968, 3969, 3970, 3971, 3972], "category": 0, "collection": 1427, "cover": 91147, "created_at": 1306921239, "dlcs": [10751], "external_games": [72963, 82049, 88774, 92783, 92784, 98260, 138255, 189040, 214036, 257127, 281299, 322612, 1303351, 2081626, 2161815, 2589100, 2608234], "first_release_date": 1317600000, "follows": 77, "game_engines": [47], "game_modes": [1, 2, 3], "genres": [5, 10], "involved_companies": [42068, 42069, 95298], "keywords": [25, 69, 453, 466, 778, 923, 1459, 3627, 4345, 4918, 5633, 8196], "multiplayer_modes": [11394, 11395], "name": "Rage", "platforms": [6, 9, 12, 14], "player_perspectives": [1, 2], "rating": 73.31271837096926, "rating_count": 237, "release_dates": [26335, 26338, 26339, 26340, 26341, 26342, 26343, 26344, 26345, 26346, 26347, 26348, 26351, 105080, 105081, 407937], "screenshots": [336, 337, 338, 339, 937], "similar_games": [1877, 3772, 19164, 37016, 54844, 55038, 101211, 103301, 105269, 113114], "slug": "rage", "storyline": "On August 23, 2029, the asteroid 99942 Apophis collides with Earth, destroying human civilization and turning the world into a wasteland. Survivors come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, while the wastes are plagued by various bandits clans, and mutants, who attack all normal humans in a voracious horde.\n\nIn 2135, former U.S. Marine Lieutenant Nicholas Raine emerges from an underground shelter called an Ark, 106 years after being put into stasis. These underground shelters are the direct result of the Eden Project, a massive international undertaking in which hundreds of Arks, containing cryogenic pods, were sealed under the surface of the Earth to preserve enough of the human population to rebuild civilization after the asteroid collision. The Eden Project was far less successful than hoped, as Raine's Ark in particular was heavily damaged, with all of its other residents dead and equipment destroyed, and he wakes up alone with no specific goal in mind.\n\nRaine enters the surface, where he is immediately attacked by bandits but is saved by Dan Hagar, a local wasteland settler who brings Raine to his settlement. Hagar informs him that a powerful technologically advanced organization known as the Authority, that considers itself the one true government of the wasteland, is hunting for Ark survivors for an unknown purpose. Raine briefly aids Hagar's settlement and others in the local area by completing a few small jobs, and during this time it is revealed that the nanotrites injected into Raine's blood before he was sent into hibernation have granted him superhuman abilities to help him survive the harsh environment, but have made him valuable to the Authority. Hagar believes Raine's continued presence is too dangerous for the settlement and sends him to the nearby town of Wellspring instead.\n\nIn Wellspring, Raine helps the town with various problems such as fighting off bandits, mutants, and ferrying supplies. Eventually, he comes into contact with Dr. Kvasir, an elderly scientist who previously worked for the Authority, who tells Raine about the inhumane experiments they were responsible for, such as the creation of the mutants. Kvasir puts him into contact with the Resistance, an armed anti-Authority group, where he is tasked with rescuing their leader, Captain Marshall, who has recently been imprisoned by the Authority. Raine again attracts attention from the Authority, forcing him to flee Wellspring and join the Resistance at their headquarters in Subway Town, where he earns the trust of the town and its tyrannical mayor, Redstone. He also learns what had happened in the past century from Captain Marshall, who is an Ark survivor himself. General Martin Cross, who was in charge of the Eden Project, sabotaged the operation shortly before 99942 Apophis struck the Earth by ensuring that only the Arks with people loyal to him were opened on schedule, with this first wave of Ark survivors eventually forming the Authority. The remaining Arks were supposed to stay underground forever in hibernation, including Raine's Ark, which surfaced only because its systems were damaged and it automatically rose to protect any surviving inhabitants.\n\nWith the Authority beginning to forcefully expand its influence on the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act with the help of Raine who can recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way to do this is to transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.", "summary": "Rage is a first-person shooter set in the not-too-distant future after an asteroid impacts Earth, leaving a ravaged world behind.

He is joined by a new partner, Sheva Alomar, who lends her strength, intelligence and sharp-shooting skills to the mission. In order to survive, Chris and Sheva must work together to take on the challenges of discovering the truth behind this evil plot. Utilizing a revolutionary new 2-player co-op mode of gameplay, players assume control of either Chris or Sheva and experience Resident Evil in new ways. In Resident Evil 5, Capcom has players fearing the daylight as much as they have feared shadow in previous games.", "tags": [1, 19, 21, 268435461, 268435487], "themes": [1, 19, 21], "total_rating": 82.00545883952834, "total_rating_count": 13, "updated_at": 1688922563, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-5-remastered", "videos": [59848], "websites": [246343, 246344, 246345, 246346, 246347, 246348, 246349, 246350, 453063], "checksum": "406f5148-ec3d-e6ef-c18c-eaea729592a7", "language_supports": [674244, 674245, 674246, 674247, 674248, 674250, 674251, 674252]}, {"id": 238702, "age_ratings": [122399, 122400, 122401, 122402, 122403, 124863], "artworks": [102429], "category": 0, "cover": 291509, "created_at": 1676675617, "external_games": [2675688, 2680319, 2680339, 2680575, 2682126, 2682223, 2682336, 2682371, 2684738, 2684967, 2708368], "first_release_date": 1677801600, "game_modes": [1, 2, 3], "name": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty - Digital Deluxe Edition", "platforms": [49, 169], "release_dates": [458519, 458520], "screenshots": [998775, 998776, 998777, 998778, 998779, 998780], "slug": "wo-long-fallen-dynasty-digital-deluxe-edition", "summary": "Set in the Later Han Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms, a nameless militia soldier uses the swordplay of the Chinese martial arts to battle demons in a dark fantasy world.", "updated_at": 1688922548, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-digital-deluxe-edition", "version_parent": 204628, "version_title": "Digital Deluxe Edition", "checksum": "83eeb731-5a96-f52b-2a6a-98e5b6cad84c"}, {"id": 10239, "age_ratings": [14135, 35354, 91594, 109318, 130437], "aggregated_rating": 68.875, "aggregated_rating_count": 10, "alternative_names": [30661, 30662, 63726, 68431, 130119], "artworks": [7232, 8330], "category": 0, "collection": 5352, "cover": 198416, "created_at": 1431432289, "dlcs": [169335], "expansions": [76206, 103514, 103515, 131698], "external_games": [9477, 75270, 78835, 94016, 94017, 111539, 190245, 210293, 245060, 343039, 399197, 1046336, 1061673, 1236992, 1865801, 1928554, 1928630, 1928640, 1929071, 1929125, 1929995, 1931465, 1933553, 1933806, 1934075, 1935725, 1936628, 1937593, 1937598, 1938261, 1942074, 1942099, 2085024, 2086179, 2086578, 2117841, 2123758, 2160646, 2175617, 2582590, 2588492, 2589326, 2627167, 2669281], "first_release_date": 1503792000, "follows": 178, "game_engines": [6], "game_modes": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "genres": [5, 12, 13, 31, 32], "hypes": 5, "involved_companies": [96995, 96996, 111238, 111239, 111240, 128182], "keywords": [87, 510, 1033, 1333, 1370, 1403, 3510, 4154, 4261, 4356, 4357, 4871, 4882, 4883, 5379, 5790, 28668], "multiplayer_modes": [7522, 16982], "name": "Ark: Survival Evolved", "platforms": [3, 6, 14, 34, 39, 48, 49, 130, 170], "player_perspectives": [1, 2, 7], "rating": 68.56761066267777, "rating_count": 150, "release_dates": [135851, 154090, 154091, 154092, 154093, 154094, 154095, 154096, 154098, 154099, 160552, 248183, 322883, 402738, 402739, 402740, 449922], "screenshots": [9990, 9991, 9992, 9993, 9994, 320946, 320947, 320948, 320949, 320950, 320951, 320952], "similar_games": [9243, 10776, 17379, 17548, 19301, 19541, 26574, 36198, 47823, 81680], "slug": "ark-survival-evolved", "summary": "Ark: Survival Evolved takes on the survival genre with a unique blend of emergent multiplayer cooperation and competition.

She informs Geralt that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him to the city of Vizima. There, Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has been recently spotted in various locations. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that bestows her with the power to manipulate space and time.\n\nGeralt first follows clues that Ciri was in Velen at Crow's Perch, the fort of the Bloody Baron. The Baron refuses to help, but Geralt's acquaintance, sorceress Keira Metz, informs him that an Elven mage, Avallac'h, was searching for Ciri. Keira directs Geralt to the Crones of Crookback Bog, malicious, ancient spirits residing near Velen. The Crones reveal that they had captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped, and that they have enslaved the Baron's missing wife, Anna. After determining Anna's fate, Geralt returns to the Baron who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad.\n\nArriving in Novigrad, Geralt discovers that the Church of the Eternal Fire, a militant religious organization, is purging mages in the city. Rendezvousing with his former lover, Triss Merigold, Geralt learns that Ciri had contacted his friend Dandelion. Geralt navigates Novigrad's criminal underworld to rescue Dandelion, and discovers that Ciri teleported to the Skellige archipelago. While in Novigrad, Geralt may assist Triss in liberating fugitive mages.\n\nAfter sailing to Skellige, Geralt reunites with Yennefer, who has been investigating a magical explosion linked to Ciri. The pair track Ciri's movements to the island of Lofoten and learn the Wild Hunt have attacked it. Following clues, they realise that Uma, a deformed, cursed creature at Crow's Perch, was present following Ciri's escape. Before leaving Skellige, Geralt can help determine who will become the leader of Skellige following the king's death. Yennefer chooses to sever the magical bond that draws her and Geralt together, giving him the option to willingly affirm his love for her or end their relationship.\n\nThe pair recover Uma to the abandoned witcher school of Kaer Morhen where Yennefer successfully removes Uma's curse, transforming him into Avallac'h. He reveals that he teleported Ciri to the Isle of Mists to save her from the Lofoten attack. Geralt travels to the Isle and finds Ciri in a deathlike state until she is awakened by Avallac'h's magic. Ciri reveals that the King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin's homeworld is being destroyed by a plight known as the White Frost, and he wants Ciri's power in order to conquer the Continent. Ciri and Geralt teleport to Kaer Morhen pursued by the Wild Hunt. After a brief reunion with Yennefer, Triss, and their witcher mentor Vesemir, the Hunt attacks. Vesemir is killed protecting Ciri and her distress causes her to uncontrollably unleash her Elder power leading Eredin and the Hunt to retreat. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and their allies then hold a funeral for Vesemir.\n\nCiri and Geralt travel to Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid in their fight. They also learn about the Sunstone, a relic that can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan isle of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, before Geralt faces Eredin in combat and emerges victorious. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. Ciri enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat.\n\nThe ending varies depending on choices made throughout the game. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with either Yennefer or Triss, or remain a lone Witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and took Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become Empress, believing it the best way to positively affect the world; if Ciri doesn't meet the Emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a Witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake, but is surrounded by monsters upon its discovery, leaving his fate ambiguous.", "summary": "Become a professional monster slayer and embark on an adventure of epic proportions!

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.\n\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.\n\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.\n\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.\n\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice.

Many of them are irreparably broken, but some are still able to function in ways that are beyond the level of understanding of most humans, who believe these objects to be magical in nature.\n\nThe protagonist of the story, known as the Last Castoff, is the final vessel for the consciousness of an ancient man, who managed to find a way to leave his physical body and be reborn in a new one, thus achieving a kind of immortality by means of the relics. Unknown to him, however, every time he abandoned \u2013 or \"cast off\" \u2013 these host bodies, they awoke with a consciousness of their own, having no memory of their former master or his deeds. The actions of this man, known as the Changing God to some, attracted the enmity of the \"Angel of Entropy\", who now seeks to destroy him and his creations. The Last Castoff, being one such \"creation\", is also targeted by the Angel, and must find their master before both are undone. To do so, the protagonist must explore the Ninth World, discovering other castoffs, making friends and enemies along the way. One means of such exploration are the \"Meres\" \u2013 artifacts that let their user gain control over the lives of other castoffs, and experience different worlds or dimensions through them. Through these travels the Last Castoff will leave their mark on the world \u2013 their Legacy \u2013 and will find an answer to the fundamental question of the story: What does one life matter?", "summary": "Torment: Tides of Numenera is a game set in the world of Monte Cook's new tabletop RPG setting, Numenera.

"slug": "alice-madness-returns", "storyline": "Within events of the first game, Alice Liddell, believing herself responsible for a fire that consumed her home and her family, escapes into a twisted version of Wonderland. While held at Rutledge Asylum for treatment, Alice was able to conquer her doubts, and eventually was released from the ward. Madness Returns takes place in 1875, a year after Alice's release. Alice, now 19 years old,[6] resides at an orphanage in Victorian London, under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to help his child patients forget their memories. Though she believes that she is fine, Alice still suffers from hallucinations of Wonderland.\n\nDuring an errand, Alice is struck by a hallucination and believes herself to be in Wonderland again. Though initially idyllic, the peaceful land quickly becomes corrupted by the Infernal Train that rampages through it, leaving behind the Ruin, a force that attempts to stop Alice. Alice meets with the Cheshire Cat who affirms that it is some outside force, not Alice, that has caused this corruption, and urges her to seek out former friends and foes to discover the source of the Train. Throughout the rest of the game, Alice briefly returns to reality between episodes occurring within Wonderland. In the real world, Alice learns from the family lawyer that her sister, Elizabeth (nicknamed \"Lizzie\"), was first to die in the fire, despite being the farthest from its source, and had been locked in her room.\n\nWithin the corrupted Wonderland, Alice attempts to learn more from Wonderland's various citizens, including the Duchess, the Mad Hatter, the Mock Turtle, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and the Caterpillar. She is ultimately told that the Queen of Hearts still lives despite her defeat at Alice's hands before, though in a diminished capacity. At the Queen's castle, Alice discovers the Queen's true form, which resembles her younger self. The Queen reveals that an entity called the Dollmaker has taken over the Infernal Train and is corrupting Wonderland.\n\nReturning to London, Alice starts to recall her memories of the night of the fire and realizes that Dr. Bumby was there. He is responsible for the death of her sister and her whole family. She comes to the conclusion that Dr. Bumby is attempting to erase the memories of the fire from her mind and, as he has done with other children, trying to leave her as a \"blank toy\" to be taken by abusive masters and child molesters for a price. Furious, Alice confronts both Dr. Bumby in the real world at the Moorgate station and Dr. Bumby's Wonderland counterpart, the Dollmaker, in her fantasy on the Infernal Train. Dr. Bumby admits to his crimes, and even attests to setting Alice's home on fire after Lizzie refused his advances, removing any witnesses to his having raped her that night. He points out that by wiping out her Wonderland, he will make her forget the events of that night, while he will continue as a member of high society.

They successfully secure the defecting Japanese scientist who was working on a secret weapon codenamed \"The Black Weapon\" (a scalar weapon), and attempt to escape the island on a stolen submarine. But after repeated warnings by the scientist, the commandos witness the effects of Black Weapon's power and subsequently perish, sparking a myth about what really happened in Operation Aurora.\n\nIn the present day, Bad Company is on a counter-intelligence operation behind enemy lines in Russia in attempt to secure a high value individual of the US military, and a device related to a scalar weapon. Despite escaping Russian soldiers, and completing what they thought was their final mission in B-company, the device is discovered to be a fake. Being impressed with their previous activities, Army General Braidwood assigns them to the Special Activities Division, and tasks them with delivering information to Agent Aguire, much to the disappointment of Sgt. Redford.\n\nThe squad travels to Bolivia in search of Aguire. Through many firefights with paramilitaries, they manage to save Aguire just before a Russian hauls him onto a waiting Mi-24 Hind. After discovering that Aguire's findings were stolen by the Russians, Aguire requests the squad to get all his intelligence detailing the scalar weapon from a satellite. The squad moves up to take the mountain with assistance from their pilot Flynn and his UH-60 Black Hawk. After taking over the satellite station, Sweetwater codes the satellite to crash, with the squad driving over cross country to find it, taking on Vodniks and Quad Bikes along the way. After reaching the satellite, the squad successfully defeat a Russian counterattack aimed at destroying the satellite, but soon bad weather rolls in. While Redford and Haggard go to find transport, with Sweetwater following, Marlowe soon finds the data storage unit and proceeds to go down the mountain during a blizzard, taking on Russian patrols, and is soon extracted by the others in Flynn's helicopter.\n\nDuring extraction, Aguire briefs the squad about the man responsible for building a scalar weapon named Arkady Kirilenko; the Russian Army colonel the squad failed to eliminate in Chukotka, who is believed to be hiding in Chile. Marlowe and the squad travel to Chile, where they, aided by US Armoured forces and Marines, find Kirilenko, though he soon escapes after US Command starts shelling Kirilenko's position. Left only with papers from Kirilenko's office, Sweetwater discovers there is a shipping manifest for a lost ship called the \"Sangre del Toro.\" Aided by the rest of the squad getting the coordinates, Marlowe finds the ship and retrieves an unnamed compound essential to the use of the weapon, and finds out the truth behind Operation Aurora.\n\nWhile attempting to meet Aguire in Colombia, the squad's helicopter is shot down by a Javelin and they become separated. Sweetwater and Marlowe regroup first, taking on a militia counter-attack, and they soon find the rest of the squad. After fighting through heavily defended Russian bases, the squad find Flynn, and then race to a helicopter base on Quad Bikes. After fighting through Russian territories in a salvaged Black Hawk, the squad reach the rendezvous with Aguire, and Marlowe gives Aguire the compound, while Redford demands to know what's happening. However, Aguire double-crossed the squad by allying with Kirilenko, his rival in the quest for the scalar weapon. Aguire wanted revenge against the United States for what happened to his father, one of the commandos in original raid on Japan, after Marlowe revealed that the US military callously sent them to their deaths. Despite the alliance, Kirilenko betrays Aguire and kills him. Flynn intervenes and saves the squad at the cost of his own life, his helicopter shot down by an RPG.\n\nWhile still mourning after Flynn's loss, the squad overhear a Russian soldier's radio, which the squad use to find their position. They begin to move towards a city, but then Kirlienko begins the detonation of the scalar weapon. The squad begin advancing through a Venezuelan city, being attacked by Russian and militia troops, along with mortars. However, as they reach the mouth of a large river, they witness a huge firefight between US and Russian troops. However, as the fight reaches a climax, the scalar weapon detonates, annihilating the US forces and sending \"all tech dead.\" The squad then fight through the blast zone in pursuit of Kirilenko, but, as the squad reach the plane, an An-124 Ruslan (Which Haggard mistakenly identifies as an An-225 Mriya), they realize it's taking off. The squad unanimously vote that they should hijack the plane, and set off through sewer tunnels towards it. Though they had to discard their weapons, they climb on board through the undercarriage, and await dawn.\n\nThe squad begins to progress through the plane, taking out multiple guards before reaching the scalar weapon, which is protected by a reinforced pane of glass, which Haggard says will \"take an act of God to get through, or a lot of C4.\" The squad then fight towards the cockpit of the plane, but realize that Kirilenko is in the Scalar chamber itself when they discover that the cockpit is empty. After detonating C4 to get through the glass, the squad destroy the Scalar weapon, and then proceed to bail out of the plane. However, as Sweetwater tries to give Marlowe the last parachute, Kirilenko tackles him, and Marlowe is forced to dive out of the plane, killing Kirilenko in a free fall with an MP-443. Sweetwater passes Marlowe a parachute in midair, and the pair land safely in Texas alongside the rest of the squad. However, as they begin to celebrate, General Braidwood tells them to follow him in a HMMVW, as the Russians are invading through Alaska.\n\nThe last cutscene shows a map of Russian forces swarming through Alaska and Canada, quickly advancing on the US border.", "summary": "Battlefield: Bad Company 2 brings the award-winning Battlefield gameplay to the forefront of PC gaming with best-in-class vehicular combat and unexpected \"Battlefield moments.\"\n\nNew vehicles like the ATV and a transport helicopter allow for all-new multiplayer tactics on the Battlefield.

After a failed ambush attempt on the Royal Italian Army and Africa Korps, Riggs is assigned to recover supplies for the British Army, alongside fellow Rat Private Desmond \"Des\" Wilmot and British lieutenant Robert Jacobs. Riggs, Des and Jacobs manage to find intelligence relating to General Erwin Rommel, and destroy a German depot in the process, but they were detained by Major Henry Hamms for insubordination. In 1942, during the Battle of El Alamein, Riggs and the Rats are ordered by Hamms to form a defensive line, but Riggs disobeys the command and tries to retake a hill and call in bomber support with Des supporting him. The two of them succeed but Des is killed in action. Angered by the disregard for the Rats' contribution to the fight, Riggs punches Hamms out of frustration, resulting him facing prison time.\n\nIn June 1942, United States Navy pilot Lieutenant Wade Jackson participates in the Battle of Midway alongside his tail gunner, Aviation Machinist's Mate Mateo Hernandez. In November 1943 while assaulting the Imperial Japanese Army in Bougainville, Jackson and Hernandez's plane is shot down, and the two are captured by IJN & IJA soldiers. They are rescued by the 93rd Infantry Division, who later help them acquire an Imperial Japanese Navy Aichi D3A to assist the division in reclaiming the island.\n\nIn August 1942, Red Army medic Polina Petrova witnesses the Luftwaffe invade Stalingrad. She fails to save her father Boris from being executed by a Fallschirmager squad, but is able to escape with her brother Misha and several Soviet partisans. Petrol eventually acquires the nickname \"Lady Nightingale\" as she pursues Leo Steiner, the Wehrmacht commander responsible for the invasion. In January 1943, Petrova and Misha attempt to assassinate Steiner in Stalingrad, but Misha is severely wounded. He sacrifices himself to buy Petrova time to escape. Petrova eventually confronts Steiner and kills him and his personal army, inspiring the citizens of Stalingrad to reclaim the city from the Heer. She then sets her sight on Steiner's superior, Hermann Freisinger.\n\nIn June 1944, British paratrooper Sergeant Arthur Kingsley takes part in Operation Tonga, where he and the Parachute Regiment help destroy the Melville Gun Battery and several other bridges to assist the Allied forces in invading Normandy. Kingsley befriends fellow paratrooper Sergeant Richard Webb, who would later become Kingsley's right hand man\n\nKingsley, Webb, Petrova, Jackson, and Riggs, alongside a sixth soldier named Milos Novak, would eventually be recruited by Captain Carver Butcher to form the first special operations task force, callsign Vanguard. Kingsley is appointed leader of the task force. In April 1945, Task Force Vanguard hijacks a train to Hamburg, Germany, in search of intelligence regarding Project Phoenix, a secret Nazi program run by Freisinger. While infiltrating a Kriegsmarine submarine, the squad is captured by Freisinger\u2019s Feldgendarmerie troops, minus Jackson who evaded them, and Novak who is bludgeoned to death by Freisinger. Vanguard is delivered to the Waffen-SS and Gestapo headquarters in Berlin, where Freisinger appoints officer Jannick Richter to interrogate them. Jackson is also captured after attempting to steal a plane; Richter demoralizes the squad by executing Webb.\n\nBeing unaware of Project Phoenix\u2019s purpose and Freisinger\u2019s involvement, Richter attempts to learn more by interrogating Petrova and Riggs about Steiner and Rommel\u2019s connection to Freisinger. He deduces that the project was a coup attempt, in order to appoint Freisinger as the new Furher of the Fourth Reich. As Berlin falls under siege by the Red Army following Adolf Hitler\u2019s suicide, Riggs breaks out of interrogation and frees the squad, while Kingsley kills Richter to avenge Webb. Vanguard pursues Freisinger to the airport, where they finally apprehend him and burn him alive. The four then board Freisinger\u2019s plane, discovering numerous German documents and assets, revealing global Nazi covert operations. Kingsley decides to follow up on Project Aggregat, a secret V2 rocket facility, and orders Jackson to fly there in pursuit.", "summary": "This is WWII combat like never before.

Previously, Dubai was a wealthy area with many high profile citizens until catastrophic sandstorms left a majority of the city buried. This caused many to evacuate, leaving only a few behind. One of the people left behind was U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad (a reference to the author of Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad), a founding member of Delta Force, who refused to evacuate from a training facility in the city and instead remained behind with the men under his command to help protect the citizens that could not evacuate.\n\nAfter several weeks of no contact, the Army fears that Col. Konrad and his men are lost to the destruction of the city until a weak distress signal is picked up. This gives the Army reason to deploy the player and their squad, who must infiltrate the city, neutralize outlaws and survive sandstorms as they attempt to determine what happened to Konrad and his men.

Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.[23]\n\nKratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and child to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, \"Ghost of Sparta\".
