Test your mettle and see if you have what it takes to beat a collection of levels created by other famous game developers.\n\nInspired by classic 8-bit days gone-by and now with experience-heightening 3D, VVVVVV will challenge even the most battle-hardened old-school gamers.", "tags": [1, 17, 18, 268435464, 268435465, 268435487, 268435488, 536870928, 536870984, 536871038, 536871049, 536871389, 536871470, 536871806, 536871859, 536871982, 536872070, 536872617, 536872898, 536873904, 536875046, 536875050, 536875168, 536875197, 536875377, 536875396, 536875453, 536875456, 536875521, 536875531, 536875621, 536875638, 536875688, 536875689, 536875702, 536875753, 536875851, 536875902, 536876174, 536876222, 536876353, 536876354, 536876634, 536876960, 536877677, 536879127, 536879691, 536880158, 536894845, 536895787], "themes": [1, 17, 18], "total_rating": 79.40559688340137, "total_rating_count": 152, "updated_at": 1688865759, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vvvvvv", "videos": [11535], "websites": [17455, 59817, 102422, 102423, 113252, 119881, 303899, 334447, 560961], "checksum": "413cb9a5-f58a-b3be-5900-abed1a4bfa97", "language_supports": [351283, 478924]}, {"id": 2165, "age_ratings": [31806, 44860, 91935, 109206, 111108, 126306], "aggregated_rating": 64.66666666666667, "aggregated_rating_count": 5, "artworks": [32174], "category": 0, "cover": 79316, "created_at": 1372140348, "dlcs": [156104], "external_games": [12658, 75788, 84450, 94309, 121618, 189713, 245168, 401723, 1185091, 2081709, 2088149, 2176279, 2586494, 2586784], "first_release_date": 1359331200, "follows": 51, "game_engines": [314], "game_modes": [1, 2, 3, 5], "genres": [5, 13, 24], "involved_companies": [187855], "keywords": [19, 36, 56, 613, 900, 992, 1107, 1158, 1333, 1827, 2180, 2385, 3831, 3910, 4134, 4135, 4225, 4886, 4887, 4901, 5306, 5333], "multiplayer_modes": [1526, 10157, 10158, 10159, 10160, 12537, 12538], "name": "War Thunder", "platforms": [3, 6, 14, 48, 49, 167, 169], "player_perspectives": [1, 2, 7], "rating": 75.46452728525628, "rating_count": 129, "release_dates": [174536, 187490, 187491, 187492, 187493, 187494, 214355, 219224], "screenshots": [3082, 3083, 3084, 3085, 3086], "similar_games": [5563, 5647, 7435, 8422, 8746, 9477, 15536, 17446, 19549, 31480], "slug": "war-thunder", "summary": "War Thunder is the most comprehensive free-to-play, cross-platform, MMO military game dedicated to aviation, armored vehicles, and naval craft, from the early 20th century to the most advanced modern combat units.

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"\u2014twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned.\n\nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19]\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21]\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Bront\u00eb's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4]\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23]\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled.", "summary": "Waking up in a seemingly empty laboratory, the player is made to complete various physics-based puzzle challenges through numerous test chambers in order to test out the new Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, without an explanation as to how, why or by whom.", "tags": [1, 18, 27, 268435461, 268435464, 268435465, 536871041, 536871049, 536871470, 536871487, 536871515, 536871874, 536871878, 536872070, 536872205, 536872334, 536872352, 536872666, 536872810, 536872885, 536872898, 536872964, 536873111, 536874398, 536874743, 536874916, 536875046, 536875047, 536875050, 536875057, 536875062, 536875117, 536875127, 536875199, 536875265, 536875271, 536875439, 536875453, 536875490, 536875492, 536875497, 536875525, 536875593, 536875830, 536875840, 536876087, 536876167, 536876174, 536876214, 536876353, 536876362, 536876520, 536876552, 536876563, 536876724, 536876869, 536876910, 536876946, 536877049, 536877101, 536877207, 536877533, 536877567, 536877647, 536877780, 536877960, 536878228, 536878256, 536878388, 536878482, 536878515, 536878565, 536879174, 536879223, 536880065, 536880253, 536880343, 536880743, 536880765, 536880901, 536881248, 536881937, 536882386, 536883945, 536883995, 536885292, 536885425], "themes": [1, 18, 27], "total_rating": 83.40630845264826, "total_rating_count": 2685, "updated_at": 1688865364, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/portal", "videos": [460], "websites": [20401, 20402, 68019, 141378, 141379, 141380, 264504, 264505, 264506, 332865], "checksum": "fb5e0d0e-f0af-dad6-00ed-172de7d9907a", "expanded_games": [21798], "language_supports": [259284, 259285, 259286, 259287, 259288, 259289, 259290, 259291, 259292, 259293, 259294, 259295, 259296, 259297, 259298, 259299, 259300, 259301, 259302, 259303, 259304, 259305, 259306, 549021, 549022, 549023, 549024, 549025, 549026, 549027, 549028, 549029, 549030, 549031, 549032, 549033, 549034, 549035, 549036, 549037, 549038, 549039, 549040, 549041, 549042, 549043, 549044, 549045, 549046, 549047, 549048, 549049], "game_localizations": [19138]}, {"id": 25076, "age_ratings": [23550, 26094, 91819, 103556, 109310], "aggregated_rating": 94.05882352941177, "aggregated_rating_count": 27, "alternative_names": [7594, 30585, 37430, 50189, 66670, 71876, 74588, 102397], "artworks": [5330, 5332, 5333, 5334, 5335, 5336, 5337, 5338, 5339, 5340, 5341, 5645], "category": 0, "collection": 2100, "cover": 80403, "created_at": 1476796480, "external_games": [82163, 105255, 210828, 248276, 1237100, 1423853, 1592807, 1708337, 1837431, 1865386, 1865453, 1865494, 1865509, 1865598, 1865679, 1865710, 1865765, 1865815, 1928409, 1928769, 1929063, 1929213, 1929976, 1931464, 1933870, 1933973, 1934005, 1934385, 1935859, 1936582, 1936921, 1937712, 1937924, 1938338, 1942203, 2083059, 2085512, 2087597, 2118708, 2172093, 2220367, 2439220, 2586579, 2586884, 2587828, 2589634, 2627365], "first_release_date": 1540512000, "follows": 769, "game_engines": [26], "game_modes": [1, 2, 3], "genres": [5, 12, 31], "hypes": 257, "involved_companies": [190251, 190252], "keywords": [9, 623, 1033, 2071, 3433, 4357, 6716, 12087, 12157, 12556, 14051, 14052, 14096, 27054], "multiplayer_modes": [21326], "name": "Red Dead Redemption 2", "platforms": [6, 48, 49, 170], "player_perspectives": [1, 2], "rating": 92.76378660327396, "rating_count": 1741, "release_dates": [137265, 137266, 177006, 179286], "screenshots": [43482, 43485, 181619, 181620, 181621, 181622, 181623, 211553, 212061, 212062, 212063, 212064], "similar_games": [1877, 11156, 19164, 19560, 19564, 19565, 26192, 28168, 36926, 47823], "slug": "red-dead-redemption-2", "standalone_expansions": [141338], "storyline": "America, 1899.

He finds a village of Mimigas, who are being persecuted by the Doctor. The Doctor's servants Misery and Balrog are looking for Sue Sakamoto, a girl who had been transformed into a Mimiga. Not finding her, they mistakenly abduct another Mimiga named Toroko instead. The player finds Sue in the Egg Corridor, where she discovers the eggs of a Sky Dragon, which could allow her to escape the floating island if hatched. Sue attempts to rescue her brother Kazuma, but King, the leader of Mimiga Village, captures her and holds her responsible for Toroko's kidnapping. Sue tasks the player with retrieving Kazuma from Grasstown. After freeing him, they meet Professor Booster, who reveals that the Doctor plans to use the red flowers on Mimigas to create an army to take over the surface world. Booster sends the player to the Sand Zone to destroy the red flowers before the Doctor can find them. While there, the player meets Curly Brace, a female robot who also has no memories of her past, and Jenka, an old witch who is Misery's mother and guardian of the red flowers. Jenka calls the player character a \"soldier from the surface\", one of many who were sent to the island to slaughter the Mimigas.\n\nMisery transports the player to the Labyrinth deep inside the island as punishment for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture him and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor was a member of the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.\n\nIf the player saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, and that they were not the killer robots who slaughtered Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access to the top of the island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Under certain conditions, the player may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where the creator of the Demon Crown, Ballos, is imprisoned. Ballos, Jenka's brother, was a powerful wizard who went insane after being tortured. Misery forced Ballos to create the Demon Crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. With the help of Curly Brace, Quote defeats Ballos and stops the source of the negative energy that was causing the island to fall, saving its inhabitants. Balrog saves the two before they are crushed by Ballos' collapsing prison\u2014he had been sent by Misery as thanks for breaking her curse.

The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters.

Players will have access to various millitary grade weapons and vehicles as well as having police equipment such as tasers and handcuffs.", "tags": [1, 23, 39, 268435461, 536870933, 536871127, 536871133, 536871134, 536871196, 536871339, 536871345, 536871361, 536871365, 536871378, 536871470, 536871474, 536871475, 536871791, 536871801, 536872070, 536872140, 536872205, 536872245, 536872581, 536872594, 536872799, 536872840, 536873455, 536873652, 536875157, 536875173, 536875194, 536875199, 536875270, 536875364, 536875432, 536875498, 536875527, 536875549, 536875756, 536875802, 536875813, 536875815, 536875830, 536875831, 536875873, 536875910, 536876176, 536876227, 536876229, 536876235, 536876289, 536876365, 536876383, 536876724, 536876901, 536876915, 536877049, 536877109, 536877147, 536877153, 536877166, 536877451, 536877499, 536877623, 536877758, 536878247, 536878265, 536878554, 536879062, 536879184, 536879819, 536880442, 536880507, 536881831], "themes": [1, 23, 39], "total_rating": 70.44337735411813, "total_rating_count": 248, "updated_at": 1688858813, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battlefield-hardline", "videos": [2662, 2841, 2849], "websites": [1751, 6629, 45639, 332514], "checksum": "d35fcd4a-55f2-bd0b-868e-a5d7e89d9087", "language_supports": [470024, 470025, 470026, 470027, 470028, 470029, 470030, 470031, 470032, 470033, 470034, 470035, 470036, 470037, 470038, 470039, 470040, 470041], "game_localizations": [4330, 19475]}, {"id": 343, "age_ratings": [1031, 67914, 93499, 109291, 109292, 117351], "aggregated_rating": 85.0, "aggregated_rating_count": 14, "alternative_names": [37594, 50332, 102274, 117595], "artworks": [11116, 11117, 11118], "bundles": [41888], "category": 0, "collection": 34, "cover": 89850, "created_at": 1300354516, "expansions": [3033, 3036, 3037, 3038, 3039], "external_games": [25353, 73590, 78961, 93075, 93076, 132591, 189413, 213217, 245599, 1305068, 1934459, 2035956, 2082957, 2162471, 2590890, 2593570], "first_release_date": 1319500800, "follows": 280, "game_engines": [2], "game_modes": [1, 2, 3], "genres": [5], "involved_companies": [4188, 4189], "keywords": [1, 21, 25, 129, 132, 307, 453, 558, 562, 563, 714, 1186, 1228, 1293, 1329, 1333, 1437, 1440, 1463, 1710, 1737, 1821, 1935, 1988, 2069, 2071, 2324, 2543, 3627, 3831, 4135, 4145, 4221, 4244, 4245, 4259, 4261, 4266, 4284, 4287, 4353, 4359, 4368, 4398, 4403, 4410, 4412, 4520, 4541, 4544, 4578, 4580, 4585, 4586, 4613, 4615, 4623, 4637, 4647, 4726, 4730, 4777, 4841, 4869, 4890, 4891, 4901, 4902, 4918, 4927, 4956, 4996, 4999, 5025, 5029, 5100, 5176, 5264, 5307, 5323, 5449, 5453, 5455, 5481, 5500, 5523, 5560, 5599, 5633, 5639, 5675, 5738, 5789, 5812, 5885, 5887, 5909, 5987, 5989, 6003, 6137, 6197, 6214, 6244, 6254, 6295, 6298, 6325, 6461, 6502, 6521, 6587, 6620, 6621, 6692, 6752, 7022, 7114, 7115, 7117, 7341, 7410, 7419, 7503, 8148, 8157, 8263, 8687, 9045, 9156, 9530, 9877, 9951, 9952, 9989, 10048, 10367, 10460, 10919, 11104, 11414, 11474, 11501, 11750, 11782, 11894, 12015, 12189, 12365, 23933], "multiplayer_modes": [624], "name": "Battlefield 3", "platforms": [6, 9, 12], "player_perspectives": [1, 2, 3], "rating": 80.3734633383961, "rating_count": 812, "release_dates": [139, 2491, 2492, 107429, 107430, 107431], "screenshots": [5760, 5761, 5762, 5763, 6441], "similar_games": [277, 545, 564, 623, 979, 1006, 1377, 1979, 2031, 2033], "slug": "battlefield-3", "storyline": "In Battlefield 3, players step into the role of the elite U.S. Marines.

Metal Gear series. It is the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes released the year before and a prequel to the original Metal Gear. The game has a complex story with long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier Metal Gear Solid titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.", "tags": [1, 17, 22, 23, 38, 268435461, 268435480, 268435487, 536870913, 536870920, 536870933, 536870934, 536870937, 536870976, 536870984, 536871041, 536871044, 536871071, 536871079, 536871101, 536871470, 536871474, 536871475, 536871487, 536871535, 536871753, 536871889, 536871945, 536872009, 536872019, 536872070, 536872131, 536872205, 536872211, 536872221, 536872245, 536872285, 536872315, 536872352, 536872371, 536872550, 536872587, 536872628, 536872691, 536872810, 536872840, 536872847, 536872865, 536872883, 536872983, 536873053, 536873192, 536873364, 536873455, 536874345, 536874398, 536874539, 536874743, 536874916, 536875046, 536875143, 536875157, 536875171, 536875188, 536875194, 536875199, 536875271, 536875296, 536875309, 536875310, 536875312, 536875364, 536875490, 536875492, 536875527, 536875623, 536875679, 536875688, 536875735, 536875763, 536875774, 536875781, 536875802, 536875809, 536875813, 536875830, 536875831, 536875839, 536875868, 536875896, 536875910, 536875935, 536876076, 536876122, 536876219, 536876220, 536876227, 536876229, 536876230, 536876235, 536876255, 536876309, 536876329, 536876363, 536876365, 536876378, 536876393, 536876398, 536876538, 536876642, 536876643, 536876724, 536876735, 536876813, 536876853, 536876875, 536876901, 536876911, 536876918, 536876978, 536876996, 536877133, 536877153, 536877160, 536877166, 536877207, 536877373, 536877499, 536877565, 536877658, 536877664, 536877691, 536877775, 536877782, 536878020, 536878025, 536878097, 536878206, 536878247, 536878253, 536878331, 536878410, 536878605, 536879133, 536879739, 536880068, 536880134, 536880240, 536880253, 536880288, 536880311, 536880378, 536880710, 536880717, 536885987, 536885988, 536888127, 536894845, 536897966], "themes": [1, 17, 22, 23, 38], "total_rating": 90.54429279517959, "total_rating_count": 871, "updated_at": 1688858552, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain", "videos": [2819, 4435, 4841, 6182], "websites": [18340, 18341, 47198, 47199, 271925, 271926, 271927, 332474], "checksum": "90d9bce6-e2f7-2a57-f14f-20bc15bc5d2b", "language_supports": [30643, 30644, 30645, 30646, 30647, 30648, 30649, 30650, 30651, 30652, 30653, 30654, 30655, 30656, 30657, 30658, 137383, 162438], "game_localizations": [2247]}, {"id": 5328, "age_ratings": [67348, 90537, 98395, 98396, 98397, 98398, 98399], "aggregated_rating": 79.21052631578948, "aggregated_rating_count": 20, "alternative_names": [76896, 76897, 76898, 76899, 107110, 107123], "artworks": [62794], "bundles": [25637, 136680], "category": 4, "collection": 2128, "cover": 87128, "created_at": 1392096075, "external_games": [10738, 41895, 80840, 80842, 87085, 97537, 121072, 213821, 250525, 401802, 401804, 1303672, 1303838, 1933130, 1935234, 2086604, 2161416, 2176246, 2183205, 2220489, 2221225, 2585931, 2586154, 2587979], "first_release_date": 1395100800, "follows": 138, "franchises": [463, 551], "game_engines": [29], "game_modes": [1], "genres": [5, 12, 15, 31], "involved_companies": [189462, 189463], "keywords": [1, 8, 562, 563, 1107, 1219, 1459, 1638, 1928, 1953, 4259, 4282, 4347, 4578, 4615, 5025, 5481, 5812, 6471, 7113], "name": "Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes", "parent_game": 1985, "platforms": [6, 9, 12, 48, 49], "player_perspectives": [1, 2], "rating": 75.8818105046194, "rating_count": 392, "release_dates": [133873, 393764, 393765, 393766, 393767, 393768, 393769, 393770, 393771, 393772, 393773, 393774, 393775, 393776, 393777, 393778, 435804], "screenshots": [4681, 4682, 4683, 4684, 4685], "similar_games": [1877, 8422, 18225, 19564, 25311, 26574, 55038, 100413, 105269, 113114], "slug": "metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes", "storyline": "The game is set in 1975 after the events of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.

During the operation, Zussman is stabbed, keeping him on the sideline.\n\nZussman returns to duty to partake in Operation Cobra, where the Allied forces successfully push to reclaim the town of Marigny. The squad is ordered by Colonel Davis to conduct a joint operation with Special Operations Executive British officers Major Arthur Crowley and Vivian Harris to intercept a German train carrying V2 rockets, near Argentan. Daniels and Zussman derail the train, before being escorted back to their squad by a French Resistance leader named Rousseau.\n\nA week later, Rousseau and Crowley infiltrate a German garrison in Paris to retrieve explosives, in preparation of the squad's assault on the garrison. Midway, Rousseau kills SS-und Polizeif\u00fchrer Heinrich, in retaliation for killing her family. The squad then successfully liberates Paris.\n\nTwo months later, the squad takes over a German-occupied hotel in the city of Aachen. They discover civilians inside the hotel, and Turner orders their evacuation, to Pierson's dismay. A young girl named Anna goes missing, and Daniels searches for her. German soldiers open fire on a truck carrying the civilians, killing Anna's older sister. Pierson sends the truck away without protection, creating a rift with Turner.\n\nAt the Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest, the platoon is ordered to take Hill 493. Turner splits the platoon into two groups; Pierson and Zussman are tasked with advancing towards the hill, while Turner and Daniels cover them until they can meet at the bottom. Turner's squad soon receives a transmission revealing that Pierson ordered an attack on the hill against Turner's orders. The platoon destroys an artillery position but the Germans counter-attack with a Tiger II tank. Daniels is knocked out trying to disable the tank, which is destroyed by tank commander Staff Sergeant Augustine P\u00e9rez. Turner is fatally wounded rescuing Daniels, and orders Daniels to abandon him while he covers the platoon's escape. Pierson becomes head of the platoon and makes Daniels his second-in-command, promoting him to Corporal.\n\nAt the height of the Battle of the Bulge, the platoon is surrounded by Germans. Daniels meets an African-American technician, Howard, who helps the platoon contact air support. The platoon captures several German soldiers and discovering that the Germans were ordered to destroy a bridge at Remagen, the last bridge over the Rhine. After destroying the explosives in transit, Pierson orders the platoon to attack a nearby air base to destroy the remaining explosives. The attack fails, resulting in Daniels and Zussman surrounded by enemy troops. Daniels is saved by Howard, while Zussman is captured and taken to a German POW camp, Stalag IX-B. In Stalag IX-B, Zussman is interrogated on his Jewish heritage by SS officer Metz, then beaten and sent to a POW labor camp. Daniels is hospitalized due to his wounds.\n\nIn the hospital, Daniels learns from Davis about the events that changed Pierson in the Battle of Kasserine Pass. After recovering, Daniels confronts Pierson in his tent and tears up his honorable discharge papers in order to rejoin the platoon. They successfully capture the last bridge over the Rhine. The platoon heads into Germany, liberating concentration camps in search for Zussman, eventually reaching the Berga labor camp, which they find abandoned. The camp's survivors were sent on a death march. Daniels finds and saves Zussman by killing Metz before he can execute him.\n\nAt the end of the war, Daniels parts ways with his platoon and returns to Texas, reuniting with his wife and newborn son. Daniels names his son Joseph Turner to honor the late lieutenant. He visits the grave of his older brother, Paul, who died fighting off a wolf to protect Red when the latter was still a kid. He places his Bronze Star medal on the grave, saying that his brother deserves it for showing him what it means to be a hero.", "summary": "Call of Duty: WWII creates the definitive World War II next generation experience across three different game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Co-Operative.

You also develop the dragon's combat abilities throughout the game to deal with the increasingly tough and resilient enemies, until you meet and conquer Skarborr himself.\n\nThat is not all, you will also need to control other characters and complete important tasks on the path to overall victory: a warlord and his steed on a potentially fatal fact finding mission, the thoroughly competent hunter on a mission of delicate accuracy and selective killing and the three huge creatures and their riders in an attempt to destroy magical generators keeping the dragons away from the next big fight.\n\nThrough 12 enormous and differing geographical areas the task is not only to hunt and destroy despicable monsters, but to build, maintain and defend human settlements.

James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of \"the waters of life\".\n\nThe main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of \"The Lone Wanderer\". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.\n\nAfter investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel.\n\nWith Project Purity still inoperable even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.\n\nAt the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic \"purity\" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel.\n\nWith the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.", "summary": "Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created.

It is the mid 1950s and the race for dominance between the US and the Soviet Union is about to move into a new dimension: space. Take charge of the US or Soviet space agencies - your duty is be the first to the moon. Carefully manage your budget by opening programs, spending R&D funds on improving the hardware, recruiting personnel and launching space missions in this realistic turn based strategy game. \n \nRoad to the Moon features the race to the Moon, the historical event that started in the early 1960s and that ended in July 1969, after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission. \n \nThe game features both a campaign and a sandbox mode. In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the Global Space Agency (GSA), an fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world . In the GSA campaign, you will need to address the requests and short-term goals issued by government, and is geared towards those players who prefer a game experience focused on exploration instead of competition. Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure. \n \nYou will be able to develop dozens of programs. Some examples include the X-15 and the PKA space planes, the Sputnik satellite, the Mercury, Voskhod, Apollo and Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Mars Viking probe. You are not limited to missions that did launch, as as the game also allows you to try out many concepts that were planned but that never left the drawing board. For example, instead of sending men to the Moon using the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) approach used by Project Apollo in the late 1960s and early 1970s, you will be able to rewrite history and use either the alternative Gemini Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) or Gemini Direct Ascent (DA) schemes.

After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) seek refuge in an abandoned mansion, where they split up.\n\nThe player character (Chris or Jill) finds several members of Bravo Team, including Kenneth J. Sullivan being eaten by a zombie; Richard Aiken, who is either killed by a giant venomous snake or eaten by a shark; Forest Speyer, who is found dead and revived as a zombie; and Bravo Team leader Enrico Marini, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being killed by an unseen shooter. Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris. The player character learns that a series of illegal experiments were undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority of a biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and animals to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus.\n\nThe player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. There, they find Jill or Chris in a cell and encounter Wesker programming a Tyrant, a humanoid bioweapon. Wesker reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant to kill the STARS members. In the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is apparently killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and contacts Brad for extraction. The ending changes depending on the player's actions at key points: in the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter after defeating the Tyrant again; in the worst ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor.", "summary": "The hugely popular Resident Evil series returns to its roots with a remastered version of the critically acclaimed masterpiece, Resident Evil.\nThe story takes place in Raccoon City, players will choose to take on the role of either S.T.A.R.S.

Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nBatman: Arkham City\nThe events of Arkham City are set one year after Batman: Arkham Asylum. Quincy Sharp, the asylum's erstwhile director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of Gotham City. Declaring both the asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary no longer suitable to contain the city's detainees, Sharp's administration orders both facilities closed and he purchases Gotham's most notorious slums, converting them into an immense prison enclosure known as Arkham City. This facility is subsequently placed in the care of psychiatrist Hugo Strange\u2014who is secretly manipulating Sharp\u2014and monitored by a rogue private military firm, TYGER Security. Strange permits the inmates to do as they please, so long as they do not attempt to escape. A wary Batman maintains his own vigil over the new project, concerned that the chaotic situation there will get out of hand. Meanwhile, the Joker is suffering from a potentially fatal disease caused by his previous consumption of the Titan formula, an unstable steroid serum which turns men into maddened monsters.\n\nAt a press conference held by Bruce Wayne to declare his opposition to Arkham City, TYGER mercenaries arrest and imprison him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence \"Protocol 10\", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10.", "summary": "Batman: Return to Arkham sees the combination of two classic entries in the Batman: Arkham series make a return to modern consoles (PS4 and Xbox One) with improved graphics.
