During the battle the Prince seeks to win honour and glory in his first battle and heads straight to the Maharajah's treasure vaults, where he discovers the mythical Sands of Time safely contained within their Hourglass and the Dagger of Time, which he quickly learns can turn back time a short amount. When the Prince presents the dagger to his father, the traitorous Vizier demands it as payment, but is refused by King Sharaman. The Persians then continue on their journey to Azad with the wealth of prisoners taken from the Maharajah, among them the Maharajah's beautiful daughter, Princess Farah.\n\nIn Azad, the Vizier, now in the service of King Sharaman, tricks the Prince into using the Dagger to release the Sands of Time from the Hourglass. A horrific sandstorm engulfs the kingdom and the Sands of Time turn all the occupants of the palace into monsters. Only the Prince, Farah, and the Vizier remain unchanged due to their possessions; a dagger, a medallion, and a staff, respectively. Amid the catastrophe, the Vizier demands the dagger from the Prince, who refuses and manages to escape.\n\nThe Prince soon teams up with Farah in an attempt to return the Sands of Time to the Hourglass, which the Vizier moves to the top of the Tower of Dawn. As they progress through the palace the pair are constantly waylaid by Sand Monsters (including a sand-possessed King Sharaman) and the deadly network of traps set in motion in the hopes of killing the creatures. The Prince becomes steadily more worn until his princely armor is mere shreds and his body covered in bloody wounds.\n\nWhile initially the Prince does not trust Farah because of the Persians' mistreatment of her, the two begin to grow closer as time goes on After a terrific battle in the ascent of the Tower of Dawn, they reach the Hourglass and are about to complete their mission when the Prince hesitates, suddenly suspicious of what Farah's motives really are. Before Farah can convince the Prince otherwise, the Vizier confronts the pair and uses his magical powers to trap Farah and the Prince in a tomb.\n\nAs they wait to die in the tomb Farah tells the Prince, who similarly reveals his claustrophobia, a story she had never told anyone before, about a time when she was little, when her mother told her about a secret magic word which would help her escape anything that scared her: \"Kakolookia\".\n\nAs soon as the Prince repeats the word, as if by magic, the Prince finds himself in a mysterious tunnel which winds down into a dreamlike bathhouse that resembles the magic fountains that the Prince earlier used to increase his health. There he meets Farah inviting him to join her bath; as they bathe, the Prince and Farah finally make love and find comfort in each other amid their perilous situation. When the Prince awakens afterwards, he finds himself back in the tomb and discovers that the magical cavern was just a dream, but he believed that Farah had shared it as well. However Farah, the Dagger, and his sword are gone, leaving him with only Farah's medallion to protect him from the Sands of Time.\n\nThe Prince, having found a new sword which destroys the sand monsters on contact, pursues and catches up to Farah once more atop the Tower of Dawn, which he must climb from the outside. When the Prince finally reaches the top, he finds Farah being overwhelmed by the sand monsters and she dangles over a cliff by the Dagger, while the Prince grab the blade; and Farah, realizing that the Prince will die to save her, instead sacrifices herself and lets go of the Dagger; and true to the game's prophecy \"if you want to live, die in love\" she falls to her death in the Hourglass room below. The Prince then tries to use the dagger to save her, but finds the sand-tanks empty since Farah had used them all. Enraged by his lover's death, the Prince uses the Dagger to massacre the last of the sand monsters in the tower and descends to weep over Farah's body. As the Prince mourns, the Vizier emerges from the shadows and offers the Prince a partnership in his evil plan, promising him eternal life; however the Prince angrily refuses because those he loved had died, and before the Vizier can stop him, the Prince drives the Dagger of Time into the Hourglass, rewinding time to the night before the invasion of the Maharajah's kingdom. The Prince awakens, still with the Dagger of Time, and secretly finds his way to Farah's bedroom, where he tells her the whole story, which she does not remember as it had not happened yet. However, the Vizier discovers the Prince, and fearing his planned treachery already revealed, attempts to kill both Farah and the Prince, telling that he suffered from consumption and would die in any event and that his plan was to cure his imminent death with eternal life. In the ensuing battle the Prince kills the Vizier. He then returns the Dagger of Time to Farah, who asks why the Prince invented such an unbelievable story to prove the Vizier's treachery. The Prince then kisses Farah, hoping she'll remember; but she rebuffs his advance, and so the Prince uses the dagger to erase the kiss, and instead he falsely tells her that it was just a story. But when Farah asks the Prince his name, he replies, \"Just call me Kakolookia\", before departing, leaving Farah amazed.", "summary": "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person puzzle-platformer and action-adventure computer and video game published by Ubisoft. It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.\n\nThe Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.\n\nThe game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.", "tags": [1, 268435464, 268435487, 536871049, 536871082, 536871301, 536871302, 536871470, 536871738, 536871758, 536871865, 536871945, 536872070, 536872257, 536873053, 536873067, 536873384, 536873540, 536873674, 536874398, 536874943, 536875047, 536875050, 536875092, 536875133, 536875157, 536875199, 536875257, 536875405, 536875453, 536875456, 536875531, 536875621, 536875638, 536875689, 536875693, 536875755, 536875768, 536875830, 536875840, 536875868, 536875902, 536876199, 536876359, 536876476, 536876511, 536876545, 536876599, 536876611, 536876695, 536876735, 536876874, 536876987, 536877049, 536877410, 536877628, 536877658, 536877659, 536877764, 536878256, 536878264, 536878387, 536878505, 536878507, 536878600, 536879761, 536879895, 536880441, 536881716, 536882765, 536883778, 536884027, 536884207, 536886180, 536886183, 536894845], "themes": [1], "total_rating": 83.21151498407504, "total_rating_count": 583, "updated_at": 1688893473, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time", "videos": [32505, 32506, 32507], "websites": [16212, 16213, 119339, 128657, 333345], "checksum": "bd9b3334-67c5-5763-7f00-227255df94ac", "remakes": [138383], "remasters": [99585], "ports": [142650, 213051], "language_supports": [299113, 474954, 474955, 474956, 474957, 474958, 474959, 474960], "game_localizations": [829, 19229]}, {"id": 2468, "age_ratings": [396, 5226, 94451, 94566], "aggregated_rating": 80.8, "aggregated_rating_count": 6, "alternative_names": [3030, 20374, 23282, 46537, 46538], "artworks": [10806], "bundles": [204142], "category": 0, "collection": 187, "cover": 116666, "created_at": 1373051583, "external_games": [14298, 62558, 88525, 98130, 130427, 214018, 219718, 247111, 402823, 403307, 2161679, 2604392, 2604423, 2604703], "first_release_date": 1274140800, "follows": 55, "franchises": [495], "game_engines": [9], "game_modes": [1], "genres": [8, 25, 31], "involved_companies": [5768, 19809], "keywords": [170, 390, 826, 953, 1033, 1293, 1320, 1440, 2071, 2141, 2155, 2280, 2543, 2762, 4134, 4135, 4138, 4245, 4266, 4345, 4347, 4359, 4541, 4580, 4890, 4918, 4928, 5000, 5308, 5403, 5564, 5657, 5783, 5792, 5814, 5823, 5850, 5901, 5904, 5909, 6022, 6493, 6664, 6746, 7352, 7369, 7688, 8983, 9200, 11474, 12748, 23933], "name": "Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands", "platforms": [3, 6, 9, 12], "player_perspectives": [2], "rating": 67.79781373952122, "rating_count": 199, "release_dates": [5294, 5295, 5297, 190202], "screenshots": [2872, 2873, 2874, 2875, 10054, 169851, 169852, 169853, 169854, 169855, 169856, 169857], "similar_games": [127, 571, 836, 837, 1006, 2437, 3025, 5181, 7020, 19441], "slug": "prince-of-persia-the-forgotten-sands", "storyline": "The Prince is riding through a desert on his horse, on a quest to see his brother, Malik, and learn about leadership from him.

The U.S. Government activates sleeper agents in the population who operate for the Strategic Homeland Defense Agency , or simply \"The Division\", to assist emergency responders, now called the Joint Task Force (JTF), in restoring order. In Brooklyn, the protagonist, a Division agent, assists the JTF before planning to depart for the Quarantine zone with fellow agent Faye Lau. However, the VTOL meant to take them there is destroyed in an explosion, killing the Division Commander and wounding Faye Lau. Arriving in a JTF helicopter instead, the Division agents reclaim the James A. Farley Post Office Building as their base of operations. From there, the agents undertake assignments to rescue important personnel, help in restoring the base of operations to full working capacity and combat criminal groups, such as the Rioters, common street thugs in New York who generally want to take advantage of the quarantine, the Rikers, escapees from Rikers Island, and the Cleaners, insane New York Sanitation workers who wield flamethrowers and believe everyone is infected. In the course of the game, the agent helps rescue important personnel like Dr. Jessica Kandel, Captain Roy Benitez and Paul Rhodes. These personnel head the Medical, Security and Tech wings of the base of operations respectively. Agents also recover a sample of Green Poison. Studying the sample reveals the virus was manufactured and then modified heavily by a controversial biologist named Gordon Amherst.\n\nEventually, the agents find footage of Division agent Aaron Keener going rogue and killing other agents. It is also discovered Keener and other agents who went rogue along with him are assisting the \"Last Man Battalion\" (LMB), a traitorous private military company that was abandoned by the government during the evacuation, now hostile to it. Working together, these two groups destroyed the VTOL and killed the Commander to weaken Division operations in New York. Intercepting a signal from the Russian consulate, the agents attempt to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a Russian virologist who claims to have information on the Green Poison. However, he is kidnapped by Keener and the LMB before the Division can reach him. After helping the JTF secure supplies and weapons, the JTF and Division agents launch an attack on the LMB's base, the evacuated United Nations headquarters. The agent finds footage of Keener and his fellow rogue agents abandoning the LMB, with Tcherneko as their prisoner. The leader of the LMB, Charles Bliss, attempts to escape in a helicopter, but the agent destroys the vehicle, killing Bliss. Lau informs the agent that with most threats destroyed or weakened, New York is approaching stability, but an unknown signal leads the agent to a secluded laboratory. There, they find Dr. Amherst's remains, having discovered that he has died from exposure to his own virus. They also find a message from Keener, showing he has the technology to manufacture a new strain of Green Poison and intends to do so, and mysteriously tells the agent to explore the center of Manhattan, called the \u201cDark Zone.\u201d The agent is informed that the information in the lab will further the development of a vaccine and is shown a recovered message from Amherst. In the message, Amherst reveals he engineered Green Poison as part of his eco-terrorist plan to decimate the human race and preserve the planet.", "summary": "After a deadly pandemic sweeps through New York, it's up to Agents to save what remains.

The old man also tells of the Island of Time, where the Empress of Time first created the Sands. The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created, an act he believes will appease the Dahaka. After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince's ship, the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time.\nHe later awakens and chases the woman in black through the Empress of Time's fortress into a portal that transports the two into the past. The Prince saves a woman named Kaileena from being killed by the woman in black, whose name is Shahdee. Unable to grant the Prince an audience with the Empress of Time, who is busy preparing to create the Sands, Kaileena instead tells him how to unlock the door to the throne room in which the Empress resides. The Prince makes his way through the fortress, utilizing the sand portals to travel back and forth between the past and present, and narrowly escapes several encounters with the Dahaka, who he discovers cannot pass through water. The Prince activates the mechanisms in the two towers of the fortress - the Garden Tower and the Mechanical Tower - that serve as locks to the door. He returns to the throne room only to discover that Kaileena is actually the Empress of Time herself, who has foreseen in the Timeline that the Prince will kill her and who has decided to attempt to defy her fate, just as the Prince is doing. A battle ensues and the Prince proves victorious; he kills Kaileena and returns to the present.

Arising from their military tradition, they have the ability to train their soldiers, promoting them from one level to another. They are the primary protagonists of the game's campaign missions. Their main Heroes are young Queen Isabel and faithful Godric, the king's uncle and the top general for the Griffin Empire.\nAn unexpected demon invasion interrupts the wedding of King Nicolai of the Griffin Empire and Lady Isabel, and soon the forces of the Griffin Empire are at war with the demons of Sheogh. With Nicolai at the front, Isabel is sent, along with the abbess Beatrice, to the Summer Palace, where they are guarded by Godric, the King's uncle. Isabel persuades Godric to let her take part in the war rather than wait. Godric is to go to the Silver Cities to seek help from Archmage Cyrus, while Beatrice will go to Irollan to get help from Elven King Alaron. Eventually, Isabel raises an army, but when Beatrice returns to lead her to meet the Elven reinforcements, Beatrice reveals that she is Biara: a succubus and assistant to a demon lord, Agrael. (In fact, Biara had the original Beatrice killed and took her guise as soon as she learned that Nicolai had sent Isabel to the summer palace.) She obviously hasn't visited King Alaron at all, and the meeting was a trap by Agrael, who captures Isabel. Isabel escapes Agrael with Godric's help (Godric failed to enlist aid from Cyrus, but returns himself), but they are too late to prevent Agrael from killing Nicolai, who, with his dying breath, proclaims Isabel to be Queen in his stead.\n\nInferno Campaign\nA dark kingdom of demons from the underworld known as Sheogh, the Inferno is a faction which uses \"Gating\", a method used to summon additional, though temporary, reinforcements onto the battlefield. Making their infernal abode on blasted lava terrain, the demons are the primary antagonists in the game, led by Urgash, the Dragon of Chaos, and their evil overlord, the Demon Sovereign Kha-Beleth. They are the protagonists of the second act of the campaign, where they are led by ambitious and ruthless Agrael.\nAlthough Nicolai is dead, Agrael has failed in his mission of capturing Isabel, and attempts to flee the wrath of Kha-Beleth, the Demon Sovereign, and raging Godric. Intending to overthrow Kha-Beleth, he decides to capture the Heart of the Griffin, which Nicolai had used in their battle, but the Demon Sovereign sends one of his servants, Veyer. When Agrael reaches the mausoleum and defeats Veyer, he is met by a mysterious Elven apparition, Tieru, who reveals that the Demon Sovereign is attempting to summon an apocalyptic Demon Messiah. He instructs Agrael to meet him in the Dragonmist Islands, which can only be reached through the Elven land of Irollan. After a long march and battles with the Elves, Agrael meets Tieru, who tells him about the War of the Eclipse, where Kha-Beleth was banished, as well as the Demon Messiah's links to Isabel. Agrael admits that he questioned Kha-Beleth's plans because he has fallen for Isabel, and Tieru tells him that he must be purified of demonic corruption with the Rite of True Nature. Agrael agrees, and during the ritual, Biara attempts to steal the Heart, only to be sent back to Sheogh.\n\nNecropolis Campaign\nOnce a secret cult flourishing within the dark underside of the Empire and the Silver Cities, the Necropolis faction resides in Heresh and is ruled by corrupted wizards who worship a twisted spider version of Asha, the Dragon of Order, seeking to find everlasting peace and beauty in death that has been denied to them in life. They can use the dark magic of necromancy to re-animate slain enemies and fill their own ranks with shambling corpses. The Hero for the Necropolis campaign is the shrewd and cunning Markal.\nMeanwhile, in the Griffin Empire, Isabel's position as Queen is challenged by Archbishop Randall and other local lords, who begin a civil war. A mysterious necromancer, Markal, appears and assists Isabel in her fight against the rebels. Markal reveals himself to be the former advisor to Nicolai's mother, Queen Fiona, and offers to help Isabel revive her dead husband with the Vampire's Garment. Although Isabel trusts him and helps him to gather its pieces, Godric is less gullible, warning Isabel that Markal had been banished years ago for his necromancy and treachery. Isabel ignores him, and as she and Markal gather the artifacts, she destroys former alliances with the Elves and the Wizards, whose leader, Cyrus, is killed by Markal for one of the artifacts. When Godric can take it no more, he keeps the last artifact and barricades himself in the Wizard city of Hikm. Markal retaliates by kidnapping his daughter Freyda as blackmail, and later defeats Godric, who is imprisoned. Isabel and Markal then begin their march to the Hall of Heroes.\n\nDungeon Campaign\nHailing from the underground empire of Ygg-Chall, the dark elves Dungeon faction are a group of fallen elves whose society is built around faith in Malassa, the Dragon of Darkness, secrecy, plots, and betrayal. They were once part of the Sylvan faction, but became renegades when they made a pact with the mysterious Faceless (in fact they are falsely accused of Brittiga's burning and the king Arniel's death, and they had to turn to Malassa for their survival). They mastered the ability of Irresistible Magic, which made their spells so powerful that even those who had the strongest resistance to magic have little chance to resist. The hero for the dark elf campaign is Raelag, a mysterious and ambitious warlock.\nIn the Dark Elven nation of Ygg-Chall, Clan Shadowbrand is holding a tournament to choose their new leader. An unknown warlock, Raelag (who is the transformed Agrael, notice that \"Raelag\" is an anagram of \"Agrael\"), participates and wins, becoming the Clanlord, and now seeks to unite the clans into a single state. With the help of another warlock, Shadya, he assimilates the other clans, except Clan Soulscar, who is discovered to be in alliance with the demons. Raelag then discovers that the Demon Sovereign has sent Veyer to capture Queen Isabel. Arriving at the outskirts of Sheogh, Raelag routs Veyer and asks Isabel to follow him to Tieru, where she can be purged of the Sovereign's influence. Markal, however, convinces her otherwise and they continue on to the Hall of Heroes.\n\nSylvan Campaign\nThe old Rampart faction from HoMM III in spirit, the Sylvan faction is more distinctly Elvish this time around, residing in Elven kingdom Irollan which is said to be blessed by Sylanna, the Dragon of Earth. Their heroes focus on archery, and so do their creatures, who can finish off their enemies without touching them. Their racial skill gives entire armies bonuses when fighting certain enemies they have slain previously. They are the counterpart to the Dungeon. The hero for the Sylvan Campaign is Findan, a diplomat and a determined fighter.\nWhen Nicolai is resurrected, Isabel realises to her horror that the spell has damned his soul, leaving him a vampire. Stunned by this revelation, she breaks down and Markal seizes the chance to declare himself ruler of the Griffin Empire.\nWhen the Elven king, Alaron, takes in Griffin refugees, Markal's forces begin to raid Irollan, and the diplomat Findan is sent to stop the raids. He is later tasked to find the Emerald Dragons to turn the tide on the Undead, but returns to find Syris Thalla, the capital, besieged. Alaron dies in the siege, but tells Findan to seek Tieru. After defending the capital, Findan travels to the Dragonmist Islands, but is too late to stop Biara from killing Tieru, although the latter's spirit tells Findan about Kha-Beleth's plan; the Demon Sovereign has placed a mark on Isabel so that she will bear the Demon Messiah. He also instructs Findan to get a scroll back from Biara, which, if used by a powerful mage, will be able to stop Kha-Beleth. The only such mage would be Zehir, the son of Cyrus.\nAfter pursuing Biara and getting the scroll back, Findan returns to Irollan, where the Elves are now on the verge of victory, but now face a terrible foe in Nicolai, who is now a Vampire Lord. With the help of Phoenixes or by destroying all the Spectral Dragons, Findan 'brings the dawn', and puts Nicolai to rest. He then sets off to find Zehir.\n\nAcademy Campaign\nThe Academy faction is a town dominated by wizards and magical creatures since its debut in the second game of the series. Not much has changed besides its location, moving away from snowy mountains of the Tower City in Heroes of Might and Magic III to a vibrant desert scene closer to the original Wizard castle, now filled with middle-eastern dress. Most of its heroes focus on magic, and their army comprises mostly shooters and flyers. Their Dragon is Sar-Elam, also known as the Seventh Dragon and the very first wizard who had so much power so he had become a Dragon and helped to banish the malicious Urgash, the Dragon of Chaos. The hero for the Academy Campaign is young and brash Zehir, the son of the late Arch-mage Cyrus and the new Arch-mage of the Silver Cities.\nWith the Silver Cities shattered by Markal's invasion, the new Archmage Zehir seeks to liberate the Wizard nation from the grip of the necromancers and avenge his father, Cyrus. Swiftly, he rallies his troops and retakes the Silver Cities, before forging an alliance with Findan and Godric. The trio manage to defeat Markal, and burn his body to ensure he cannot return as a lich. Determined to rid Isabel of demonic influence, they ally themselves with Raelag and Shadya and successfully get to Isabel, preparing to do the Rite of True Nature.\nHowever, Shadya then reveals herself to be Biara in disguise and seizes Isabel before fleeing to Sheogh, where the Demon Sovereign waits. The heroes travel there as well, and in an epic battle, they defeat the Demon Sovereign, who escapes with Biara. With Isabel free, they then return to their respective countries.\nAs Godric and Isabel survey the damage in their homeland, Isabel's eyes light red, implying that the demons of Sheogh are not quite defeated yet.", "summary": "Witness the amazing evolution of the genre-defining strategy game as it becomes a next-generation phenomenon, melding classic deep fantasy with next-generation visuals and gameplay.\nIn the renowned Might & Magic universe, demon swarms spread chaos over the land in a relentless assault.

After opening a route for future missions, they are sent to clear out machine threats for the Resistance, led by Anemone, who provides the two with support. During their missions, 2B and 9S discover that the machines are exploring human societies and concepts. The two work with a pacifist machine group led by Pascal; battle Adam and Eve, physical manifestations of the machine network who reveal that their creators were destroyed centuries ago and encounter A2, a rogue android on the run from YoRHa. Adam is killed by 2B after he captures 9S. During his recuperation, 9S discovers a glitch in YoRHa's servers when syncing himself and 2B, and learns that humanity was extinct long before the alien invasion. Their last remnant is a Moon-based server holding humanity's incomplete genome remains. YoRHa perpetuates the myth of their survival to maintain morale and give androids a \"god\" to fight for. With Adam dead, Eve goes mad with grief and drives the machines under his command into a frenzy. 2B and 9S kill Eve to end the rampage, but 9S becomes infected with Eve's logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. However, 9S's consciousness survives within the local machine network.\n\nThe third playthrough begins as YoRHa launches a full-scale invasion. A logic virus attack\u2014enabled by the \"glitch\" that 9S previously discovered\u2014corrupts every YoRHa unit including those in the Bunker, except for 2B and the restored 9S. 2B and 9S are separated in the aftermath, and 2B is infected with the logic virus. Discovered by A2, 2B uploads her memories into her sword and asks her to look after 9S. An ignorant 9S witnesses A2 mercifully killing 2B and swears revenge on her. Simultaneously, a tower created by the machines rises from the land, separating the two before they can fight. The perspective splits between A2 and 9S a fortnight after these events. A2\u2014the survivor of a test run for YoRHa\u2014finds herself empathising with the machines; she witnesses Pascal's village being destroyed, then its \"children\" committing suicide out of fear when attacked. Pascal begs A2 to either wipe his memory or kill him; A2 can perform either task or leave him. An increasingly-unbalanced 9S investigates the tower's resource-gathering platforms, fighting machine remnants and learning the tower is designed to launch a missile at the Moon server.
