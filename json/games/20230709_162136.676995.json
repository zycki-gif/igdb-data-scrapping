Laharl vows to reclaim the throne, and, after consulting with Etna and his other vassals, goes to Vyers' castle.\n\nAfter defeating the demon Vyers, who refers to himself as the \"Dark Adonis\" and is renamed \"Mid-Boss\" by Laharl, he meets Angel Trainee Flonne. Flonne had been sent to the Netherworld by Seraph Lamington, the ruler of Celestia, to assassinate King Krichevskoy (who was already dead). Shocked by Laharl's lack of grief at his father's death, the eternally optimistic Flonne joins Laharl's party to determine if demons are capable of feeling love. Observing them in secret is the paranoid Archangel Vulcanus, who interprets Flonne's actions as treason and is convinced that she is plotting against him.\n\nAfter Etna demands that Laharl pay the salary of the Prinnies that she has hired, he decides to attack the demon with the most money in the vicinity. This is Hoggmeiser at Dinero Palace. After defeating Hoggmeiser, Laharl is about to kill him, until Hoggmeiser's son rushes out and gets in the way. Flonne convinces Laharl to spare them, and Laharl lets them keep some of the money. In response to this act, Hoggmeiser joins the party.\n\nAt one point, Flonne and Etna discover a photograph of Laharl in an embarrassing situation. Laharl refers to this as a \"paparazzi shot\", however, the actual contents of the photo are never actually revealed. A threat on the back of the photograph states that copies of it would be distributed if Laharl did not accept a challenge to fight for the overlordship; thus Laharl was blackmailed.\n\nResponding to this challenge, Laharl meets Maderas, a vampire. He was banished by King Krichevskoy, for stealing the King's favorite snack, black pretzels. Maderas takes advantage of Laharl's two biggest weaknesses \u2013 optimism and women with sexy bodies. Maderas was also controlling Etna by holding her memory. He had instructed her to kill the prince, but she had put him to sleep for two years by poisoning him instead.

Rool, aboard his vessel, The Flying Krock, commands his minions to invade the island and take Donkey captive so that his next attempt at stealing the banana hoard will not be a failure and the hero will never mess with his plans again. Donkey, still lounging, did not notice the attack until Kutlasses ambushed him and took him prisoner. Kaptain K. Rool assures Donkey Kong that he will never see his precious island or his friends again.\n\nLater and back on the island, Diddy, Dixie and Cranky Kong find Donkey missing, along with a note. It reads:\nHah-arrrrh! We have got the big monkey! If you want him back, you scurvy dogs, you'll have to hand over the banana hoard!\nKaptain K.

In the game's history, around the seventh or eighth centuries a small number of humans took on bestial traits. The majority of humans feared these half breeds and war broke out. Despite the humans outnumbering the half breeds, their animal strength gave them the upper hand in centuries of conflict.\nCenturies later, humanity finds new hope in King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. King Arthur and his like-minded knights take the fight to the half breeds, but Arthur soon realizes it's a losing battle. Through a mysterious turn of fate The Knights discover Black Water, a mystical liquid that significantly extends their lifetimes and gives them remarkable healing abilities. Despite this new advantage the half breeds continue to win battle after battle, until the industrial Revolution turns the tide. Inventors are far ahead of their time, inventing technologies such as thermal imaging, Zeppelins, and wireless communications. New weapons belch electricity, ignite clouds of molten metal on top of enemies, and fulfil dual functions as Fragmentation grenades and proximity mines.\nBy 1886, the war still goes on, but the humans almost have martial law. A new threat emerges in the form of the lower classes rebelling against the rich and the social order, with the Knights supporting the well-to-do upper classes and nobles. The game features four main protagonists from the same squad, who each has a given name, and the adopted name of one of the original Knights. The oldest is Sebastian Mallory, the second to bear the name of Sir Percival, and the descendant of Thomas Mallory, who in the 1400s wrote Le Morte d'Arthur, the definitive Arthurian Text. A close friend of Grayson, he is one of the best Knights in the history of the order.\nGrayson is the third to bear the title of Sir Galahad, and has battled the order's enemies for centuries. He views Mallory as a mentor, Lafayette as a friend, and Isabeau as a potential love interest. Other than that, little is known about him so far. Isabeau D'Argyll is one of the younger Knights in the order, but is much older than her appearance of being in her late twenties. The latest Lady Igraine, Isabeau was Grayson's apprentice and if not for her commitment to the order, his lover. Marquis de Lafayette was a French military officer who fought in the French and American Revolutions. His tactical expertise brought him to the order's attention, and Mallory approached him and convinced him to join the order. Although the group's youngest, his globetrotting has given him a whimsical outlook on life that grounds the squad. As an apprentice, he does not yet bear the name of a Knight.", "summary": "The Order: 1886 introduces players to a unique vision of Victorian-Era London where Man uses advanced technology to battle a powerful and ancient foe.

With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to their role as an explosives expert (codenamed \"Alias\") as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth.\n\nEventually, the research is successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. However, fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down, executed, and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as \"The Processed\". Collectively betrayed by their leader, the player's squad flees underground and ally themselves with the Red Faction as mercenaries. The Red Faction at this point in the story is an organized resistance movement that is strongly opposed to the rule of Sopot and the skewed political tenets of The Commonwealth. The squad eventually pursues Sopot and neutralizes all opposition in their way as the Red Faction takes the conflict to the streets in a joint uprising against the rule of The Commonwealth. During the initial stages of the game, the Red Faction and the squad mutually support each other as they overcome shared objectives such as sabotaging propaganda installations. The uprising culminates in successfully trapping Sopot in his missile silo and executing him.\n\nAlias returns to the makeshift base of operations only to discover that all of the Red Faction resistance members present have been brutally slaughtered. The squad's leader, Molov, remarks that with Sopot dead and with the nanotech research in his possession, the Commonwealth's military forces have voluntarily pledged allegiance to him. He declares Alias and Tangier, a fellow squadmember, to be enemies of the state for supporting the Red Faction. Tangier helps Alias escape, and shortly after fleeing to safety, Alias lends aid to surviving Red Faction members who are defending themselves from the enemy. Alias and Echo, another squadmember, meet up in a secret location to discuss an alternate strategy to stop Molov, and Echo is killed in action during a firefight with Quill, a former squadmember. Tangier radios Alias soon afterward, and the two agree to shut down Molov's commandeered nanotech laboratory located within the colossal statue of Sopot. Inside the laboratory, Alias triumphs over Repta, a former squadmember, and destroys the nanotech laboratory's power generators. Alias's explosives weaken the foundation of the statue and render it unstable. Alias encounters Repta again and once again triumphs over him, causing the energy field within Repta to reach critical mass.\n\nAlias and Tangier meet up and pursue Molov, who is scaling Sopot's statue with the nanotech cell \u2013 the culmination of Capek's research \u2013 and awaiting extraction from Shrike, Molov's subordinate. Shrike betrays his commanding officer, and Tangier manages to reclaim the nanotech cell from Molov's possession. Molov, desperate to eliminate his enemies, climbs aboard a nearby battle armor and launches a frenzied assault against Alias. Using the destructible environment to his advantage, Alias manages to evade Molov's fire and launches a counterattack that not only kills Molov, but also destroys the statue. As the statue crumbles, Shrike swoops in with his close air support craft to extract Alias. From this point, the story ends in one of four possible ways, depending on the player's Heroics score.", "summary": "In Red Faction II you will have to defend your country as Alias, a demolitions expert, with the help of your five squad members, each specializing in their own method of destruction.

Dr. Edward Richtofen is heard via a television, carrying out his scheme on the Moon. Richtofen seizes control of the zombies by entering the Aether, but Dr. Ludvig Maxis works with his daughter Samantha and Richtofen's former allies, Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masakai to thwart him. To this end, Maxis launches three massive nuclear missiles filled with Element 115, the element responsible for the reanimation of dead cells, at the Earth, destroying it. One missile completely destroys Nuketown and all present.\nYears later, Earth has been reduced to a crumbling, hellish wasteland overrun by zombies. In this new world, four survivors - Samuel J. Stuhlinger, Abigail \"Misty\" Briarton, Marlton Johnson, and Russman - have banded together to survive in Washington with the help of a bus driven by a robotic driver. The four are contacted by Maxis, now an digitally-rendered A.I., who is seeking humanity's aid against Richtofen. Maxis implores them to power up a tower in a cornfield using an electricity-based zombie. However, Richtofen contacts Samuel, who is able to hear voices from the Aether, and commands him to convince his friends to power up the tower in his favor. The player may choose to follow either Maxis or Richtofen's orders. It is revealed in audio transmissions that survivors from all over the world have been contacted by both Maxis and Richtofen, though there is widespread conflict between the followers of both Germans; particularly in a settlement known as Jackass Flats, which was initially a safe haven, only to fall to the zombies when the Maxis-Richtofen conflict consumed it.\nRegardless of who they choose to aid, the four are teleported to a crumbling skyline in Shanghai, China. Here, Richtofen commands Samuel to \"mend the rift\" and accept his fate as a follower of Richtofen, threatening to expose his past as a member of a cannibalistic cult known as The Flesh, who eat zombie flesh to survive. Richtofen continuously revives the group whenever they fall to the zombies until they follow his orders. Maxis, who is no longer hampered by electric devices, contacts the group again for aid. The four learn through televisions scattered across the area of the Flesh, as well as the beginnings of a new airborne plague of Element 115, the element that reanimates dead cells and causes zombies.\nFollowing their battles in Shanghai, Russman leads the group across the continents to a large hole in the ground known as \"the Rift\" in Africa, hoping to find answers about the unseen forces commanding them. Maxis and Richtofen contact them once again, more desperate than ever to achieve their goals. Both of them ask the group to power up the third and final tower in their favor. Maxis promises to heal the Earth, and Richtofen promises to save them from Maxis. The four gain a new ally in the form of a mute, unnamed giant in a western town built underground, and are hampered by a ghostly woman in a massive mansion. Depending on who the player has aided in the story, there are two possible endings. If the player has aided Richtofen, he will gain unlimited power over the Aether and the Earth, kill Maxis and condemn Samantha Maxis' soul to eternal damnation. He will then enter the body of Samuel as a reward for his aid, but finds he cannot exit it, and is at the mercy of the zombies as he was before. If the player has aided Maxis, he uses the power from the towers to enter the Aether and assume ultimate control, trapping Richtofen in a zombie's body. However, the Earth begins shaking, and Maxis explains to the four that he is beginning the process of the destruction of the Earth and humanity to reach Agartha, where he believes Samantha is.\nUnbeknownst to all, Samantha is indeed in Agartha (which her father ultimately fails to enter) but reaches out to her father in 1918 France during World War I. Maxis is a leader of Group 935, who operate to secure Germany's victory in the war. To this end, they have created towering mechanical robots, suits of armor, and staffs that control the powers of the elements. Group 935 also stumbles upon an ancient tomb believed to be of Vrill origin, but this unleashes the first known zombie outbreak in history. Aiming to stop Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States of America send Takeo, Nikolai and Dempsey to capture Richtofen, the mastermind behind the advanced technology. By this time, Group 935's operatives have been wiped out, and Maxis himself was lobotomized when he began to turn into a zombie. The group put aside their nationalities to fight the undead, and are contacted by Samantha, begging to be freed from Agartha. Richtofen puts Maxis' brain in a flying drone, and he joins the fight against the zombies and to free Samantha. The group is eventually successful, and while Maxis meets his daughter, they enter Agartha to be rewarded.

A CIA agent named Sonia enters the place and asks for Ryu Hayabusa's whereabouts, until members of the Black Spider Ninja Clan attack the shop and kidnap her. Enter the Dragon Ninja Ryu, who fails to stop Sonia's kidnapping and makes haste around the Tokyo skyscrapers and rescues the agent, who informs him of an attack on the Hayabusa Village by the Black Spider Ninjas, who wish to steal the Demon Statue they possess and protect.\n\nRyu returns to his home and finds his father, Joe Hayabusa dueling with Genshin, leader of the Black Spider Ninja Clan. Unfortunately, the Demon Statue is taken away by Queen of the Greater Fiends and the Ruler of Blood, Eliz\u00e9bet, and Joe urges his son to retrieve the statue at all costs. Ryu travels around the world with Sonia, in pursuit of Eliz\u00e9bet and the Demon Statue, while encountering legions of Black Spider Ninjas, Fiends, and three other Greater Fiends: Alexei, the Graceful Ruler of Lightning; Volf, the Invincible Ruler of Storms; and Zedonius, the Malevolent Ruler of Flame.\n\nRyu tracks Eliz\u00e9bet down to South America, where she offers the Demon Statue to Infernal High Priest Dagra Dai, in order to resurrect the ancient Archfiend, Vazdah. Eliz\u00e9bet duels with Ryu and he defeats her, but Eliz\u00e9bet proclaims her return. An overlooking Genshin explains that the fiends are looking to resurrect the Archfiend who is supposed to emerge from Mount Fuji back in Japan. The mountain is also the place which bound both the Black Spider Clan and The Dragon Lineage. Ryu returns home, cautioning Sonia not to follow him.\n\nAs Ryu overlooks the fire-brimming Mount Fuji, Ayane enters with the Eye of the Dragon, a gift from Joe Hayabusa, and Ryu equips the relic onto his Dragon Sword, forming the True Dragon Sword again. Heading to the mountain's summit, Ryu finds Genshin waiting for him at the crater's entrance. As Mount Fuji erupts, Genshin reveals to Ryu that he never cared for \"tantrums of the archfiend\" and that their moment has finally arrived. The two ninjas fight to the death before Genshin falls dead and Ryu leaps into Mount Fuji. Eliz\u00e9bet appears over a deceased Genshin looking to revive him as a fiend as Ryu descends into Mount Fuji.\n\nRyu fights past hordes of Fiends and singlehandedly defeats Zedonius, Volf, and Alexei, and rescues a captured Sonia. He instructs her to stay put and to not move. Ryu heads into another room and finds a resurrected Genshin, transformed into a Fiend, back for a fourth and final battle. The two ninja battle in another arduous battle ending with Ryu eventually cutting Genshin down, even splitting his face armor doing so. Genshin and Ryu, though mortal adversaries, share a final mutual respect as ninja in Genshin's dying moment. Genshin shares with Ryu that all of his actions were meant to strengthen the Black Spider Clan as a whole (his cause all along) and has no regrets of pursuing that. He acknowledges Ryu as a great warrior, and in support of Ryu's cause hands him the cursed blade of the archfiend for use before dying. A furious Eliz\u00e9bet appears, and chastises the Black Spider Ninja for losing, even with his power. Ryu attacks Eliz\u00e9bet, and angrily cuts her down to red dust with the combination of his own dragon sword and Genshin's blade of the archfiend. He states that the overlord had more to live for than she ever would.\n\nTraveling deeper into the Underworld, Ryu confronts Dagra Dai, who is nearly finished with the Archfiend's resurrection, and defeats him. As a last resort, the Infernal High Priest offers his life to Vazdah, and the Archfiend is reborn. Ryu takes down the monstrosity and heads to the surface with Sonia, but a drop of his blood from an open wound accidentally spills onto the fiend and revitalizes Vazdah, who ascends to the summit in its true form. Amidst an erupting Mount Fuji, Ryu squares off with the Archfiend in a climatic duel to decide humanity's fate and wins. Sonia and Ryu reunite and climb to the top of the mountain, sharing the sunrise together.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, amongst a field with countless number of blades embedded into the ground, Ryu plants Genshin's Blade of the Archfiend into the ground and bows in respect for the Black Spider Overlord. The Dragon Ninja takes one last look before taking off into the fog.

Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation.\n\nDarksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.\n\nLike the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including 'The White city', an outpost where angels live, and 'The Eternal Throne', a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair.", "tags": [1, 17, 38, 268435460, 268435465, 268435468, 268435481, 268435487, 536871389, 536871449, 536872220, 536873338], "themes": [1, 17, 38], "total_rating": 75.18472993845285, "total_rating_count": 72, "updated_at": 1688749665, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/darksiders-ii-deathinitive-edition", "videos": [19228], "websites": [36100, 78727, 78728, 78729, 78730, 78731, 78732, 118672, 128778, 309391, 309392, 453697], "checksum": "07f11ddf-bacb-cfc6-6802-7e76e1ccc08b", "language_supports": [114503, 114504, 114505, 114506, 114507, 114508, 114509, 114510, 114511, 114512, 114513, 114515, 114517, 114519, 114521, 114523, 114525, 114527, 114529, 114531, 114532, 114533, 114534, 114535, 500587, 500588, 500589, 500591]}, {"id": 119342, "age_ratings": [56201, 66693, 74828, 110228, 110777, 122833, 125327], "aggregated_rating": 86.33333333333333, "aggregated_rating_count": 4, "artworks": [7460, 7461], "category": 0, "collection": 1349, "cover": 138329, "created_at": 1560186955, "external_games": [1775880, 1914525, 1942511, 1942603, 2001654, 2002601, 2002639, 2002677, 2012310, 2012371, 2012380, 2012402, 2062046, 2064551, 2071980, 2082040, 2085500, 2086376, 2088258, 2118546, 2175890, 2220465, 2441784, 2581079, 2586637, 2589939, 2590587, 2608398, 2625802], "first_release_date": 1623110400, "follows": 2, "game_modes": [2], "genres": [4, 8, 24, 25, 32], "hypes": 2, "involved_companies": [118978, 118979], "keywords": [466, 1308, 1884, 2392], "multiplayer_modes": [13263], "name": "Chivalry 2", "platforms": [6, 48, 49, 167, 169], "player_perspectives": [1, 2], "rating": 82.10293636502085, "rating_count": 13, "release_dates": [228259, 228260, 228261, 228262, 251687, 251688, 251689, 416988], "screenshots": [307713, 307714, 307715, 307716, 307717, 307718], "similar_games": [19164, 20342, 21642, 24426, 30229, 36553, 55190, 56033, 78550, 117497], "slug": "chivalry-2", "status": 3, "summary": "Chivalry 2 is a multiplayer first person slasher inspired by epic medieval movie battles.

Technology based on the metal revolutionized the field of Reploid engineering. The Federation built Giga City, an artificial island, near the meteor site for the explicit purpose of mining and smelting Force Metal.\n\nEverything seemed to go well, until a band of renegade Reploids armed themselves and launched a rebellion on the island. They banished all humans and demanded that the government recognize Giga City as an independent Reploid state. This new Rebellion Army and its leader, Epsilon, were all branded Mavericks for this deed.\n\nAfter the first team of Maverick Hunters was annihilated or otherwise subdued by the Rebellion Army, Colonel Redips sent in a special team composed of X, Zero, and Shadow. If they failed their mission - arrest Epsilon and quell the Reploid insurrection - the Federation would have no choice but to declare all-out war on Giga City and the Rebellion Army.\n\nChapter 1: Infiltrate Giga City!\nX, Zero, and Shadow teleport to the outskirts of Giga City to investigate an energy reading in the Lagrano Ruins. The trio are separated by a mysterious explosion, but they continue towards the top of the structure. X and Zero meet up near the top when they are suddenly attacked by Hippopressor, which they destroy.\n\nUpon making it to the roof, X and Zero find Shadow faced with Epsilon. They begin to arrest Epsilon, but Shadow turns on them, revealing his true allegiance to the Rebellion Army. The Rebellion cadres - Scarface, Botos, and Ferham - also reveal themselves, and the Hunters realize that they've been led into an ambush. Zero attempts to strike Epsilon, but is overpowered and sent flying by the cadres attacks. Now alone, X finds himself with no other choice but to flee, leaping off the roof and into a chasm below. Ferham begins to give chase, but Epsilon stops her, well-aware that X will return.", "summary": "Mega Man X: Command Mission, known as Rockman X Command Mission in Japan, is a spin-off game in the Mega Man X series. It was released in 2004 on both the PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo GameCube, making it the second-to-last game in the Mega Man X series to be released. Unique to the series, it is an RPG featuring turn-based combat and an extensive story. It plays quite similarly to Capcom's signature Breath of Fire series in a number of ways, due to the shared development team. Chronologically, it is currently the Mega Man X game set furthest in the future, taking place sometime in the twenty-third century (22XX time period); however, it is also set in an alternate timeline outside of the main storyline of the Mega Man series.\n\nThe Gamecube version let's you link up to Game Boy Advance so you can use the GBA as a treasure hunter locater.

A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers. Game modes are also present such as the traditional Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial modes.", "tags": [1, 27, 40, 268435466, 536870937, 536871192, 536872983, 536874539, 536876639, 536877113, 536878155, 536880839, 536888053, 536907598], "themes": [1, 27, 40], "total_rating": 75.71667350596326, "total_rating_count": 455, "updated_at": 1688746074, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-kart-wii", "videos": [1279], "websites": [573, 52385, 265285, 512994], "checksum": "059fa0f1-885c-d540-0d21-36e6d25a8312", "ports": [191437], "game_localizations": [2533, 2534]}, {"id": 90628, "age_ratings": [23023, 93876, 96063, 108484, 108485, 117298], "aggregated_rating": 85.75, "aggregated_rating_count": 5, "alternative_names": [104996, 108523], "artworks": [7205], "bundles": [173127], "category": 3, "collection": 24, "cover": 110782, "created_at": 1520951073, "external_games": [307197, 1238540, 1466817, 1592888, 1865793, 1928874, 1928884, 1929911, 1930156, 1930274, 1931221, 1931336, 1934095, 1934121, 1934333, 1936741, 1937117, 1938240, 2072543, 2172218, 2439154, 2443886, 2443897, 2443911, 2443912, 2584984, 2586680, 2588737, 2591075, 2597132, 2601903], "first_release_date": 1498521600, "follows": 3, "franchises": [2417], "game_modes": [1, 2, 3], "genres": [12, 31], "involved_companies": [220114], "keywords": [4357, 16826], "multiplayer_modes": [8882, 17091], "name": "Diablo III: Eternal Collection", "platforms": [48, 49, 130], "player_perspectives": [3], "rating": 83.3701472934432, "rating_count": 58, "release_dates": [484689, 484690, 484691], "screenshots": [215595, 215596, 215597, 258277, 258278, 258279, 258280, 258281, 258282, 258283], "similar_games": [27092, 28168, 28309, 55199, 81249, 96217, 103303, 106987, 113360, 115280], "slug": "diablo-iii-eternal-collection", "summary": "Generations of gamers have battled the demonic hordes of Diablo, and now it\u2019s your turn to take part in the action-RPG legacy.

The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we\u2019ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You\u2019ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that\u2019s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You\u2019ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It\u2019s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you\u2019ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.", "tags": [1, 23, 38, 268435461, 268435480, 268435487, 536870932, 536870934, 536871044, 536871813, 536871945, 536872131, 536872581, 536874136, 536874804, 536875091, 536875132, 536875188, 536875269, 536875783, 536875794, 536875795, 536875830, 536876911, 536884963, 536884964, 536884981, 536887738, 536889862, 536894845], "themes": [1, 23, 38], "total_rating": 79.96562341828405, "total_rating_count": 456, "updated_at": 1688736263, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hitman", "videos": [4417, 4454, 6149, 6944, 6978, 7154, 7261, 7504, 7967, 9608, 10888, 11777], "websites": [4029, 4030, 47882, 52569, 62792, 62794, 75054, 150850, 229070, 332390], "checksum": "1dd804af-e9e3-3103-a7ff-1f226c5b2e6c", "language_supports": [374201, 374204, 374206, 374209, 374211, 374213, 374215, 374217, 374219, 374222, 374224, 374226, 374229, 374233, 374236, 374240, 374244, 374249, 374254, 374259, 374264, 686859], "game_localizations": [19584, 27008]}, {"id": 159683, "artworks": [44502], "category": 0, "cover": 162956, "created_at": 1627887870, "external_games": [2015713, 2075687, 2078907], "first_release_date": 1617148800, "game_modes": [1], "genres": [2, 31, 32], "name": "The Mansion", "platforms": [6], "release_dates": [435232], "screenshots": [555221, 555222, 555223, 555224, 555225, 555226, 555227, 555228, 555229, 555230, 555231, 555232, 555233, 555234, 555235], "similar_games": [236, 13189, 18011, 25222, 26223, 27725, 80916, 81275, 106992, 111130], "slug": "the-mansion--1", "status": 4, "summary": "The Mansion, a grim yet fascinating building you're facing, doesn't exist.", "tags": [43, 268435458, 268435487, 268435488], "themes": [43], "updated_at": 1688736262, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-mansion--1", "videos": [81606], "websites": [206451, 226222, 417553], "checksum": "20bb5f51-93c7-3f62-b56a-60c25ba9d146", "language_supports": [484079, 484081, 484083, 484085, 484087, 484089, 484092, 539781, 539782, 539783, 539784, 539785, 539786]}, {"id": 193745, "age_ratings": [102387], "artworks": [70613], "category": 1, "cover": 212559, "created_at": 1646753959, "external_games": [2227146, 2625074], "game_modes": [1], "genres": [5, 33], "name": "R-Type Final 2: DLC Set 5", "parent_game": 116899, "screenshots": [753201, 753202, 753203], "similar_games": [32902, 38030, 43367, 76263, 87728, 103292, 106805, 117939, 119177, 119493], "slug": "r-type-final-2-dlc-set-5", "summary": "R-Type Final 2 - DLC Set 5 comes with two additional stages.

Before his death, the Joker sent his mutated blood to Gotham's hospitals, and several patients were infected. While most were cured, the patients who were not treated are starting to look and act like the Joker. Batman researches a cure for the mutations, and orders Robin to watch over the infected.\n\nThe Arkham Knight\nOn Halloween night, Scarecrow unleashes his newest strain of Fear Gas in a diner, and threatens to release it throughout Gotham. Six million civilians are evacuated, but the city's criminals and supervillains stay behind, leaving Commissioner James Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department outnumbered. Batman investigates Scarecrow's presence, and searches for him in a rooftop safehouse, but instead finds and saves Poison Ivy, who was being held captive by Scarecrow's henchmen. In a makeshift Batcave in Gotham's Clock Tower, Barbara Gordon is collecting information on Scarecrow's new toxin, and traces its production to Ace Chemicals. Batman goes to investigate, but is confronted by the mysterious \"Arkham Knight\" and his militia, which has a massive army of unmaned tanks. Batman fights his way through the militia, learning from workers that Scarecrow is planning to produce a chemical explosion so large that it will cover the entire eastern seaboard in fear toxin. Batman reaches Scarecrow, who reveals to him that Barbara has been abducted by the Arkhan Knight before escaping. While reducing the blast radius, Batman is exposed to the fear toxin, which reacts with his own mutated blood to cause hallucinations of the Joker. Escaping from the exploding Ace Chemicals, Batman is forced to tell Gordon about his daughter's involvement in his crime-fighting, and the outraged Gordon swears that he will find Barbara without Batman's help.\n\nScarecrow's Plans\nBatman tracks the Arkham Knight to an underground tunnel network, hoping to learn Barbara's whereabouts from him, but instead gets ambushed by him. Batman then gives chase to the escaping convoy, only to learn that the driver is a decoy, using a voice synthesizer that makes him sound like the Arkham Knight. Batman interrogates the driver and learns that they are heading to the North Refrigeration. He and Nightwing interrogate the Penguin, who tells them that the Knight and Scarecrow are meeting with a businessman named Simon Stagg, who runs a pharmaceutical company. After boarding Stagg's airship, Batman discovers that Scarecrow paid Stagg to create a device known as the \"Cloudburst\", but Stagg tried to double-cross them and has been doused with fear toxin as punishment. After reaching Scarecrow and interrogating Stagg, Batman is again exposed to the toxin, which triggers a powerful hallucinogenic response. Scarecrow escapes with the Cloudburst. Batman receives a message from Scarecrow revealing that Barbara is in the same safehouse where Ivy was held, but before Batman can save her, Barbara is doused with fear toxin and shoots herself in the head. Batman and Alfred Pennyworth are devastated, but Alfred convinces Batman to not lose hope, for Barbara's sake. Alfred explains to Batman that the Cloudburst is a dispersal device designed to flood all of Gotham with the fear toxin. To counteract this effect, Batman enlists the help of Ivy, who takes control of a large tree which develops giant flowers capable of neutralizing the toxin.", "summary": "Includes the main game and the season pass.\n\nIn the explosive finale to the Arkham series, The Scarecrow returns to unite an impressive roster of super villains, including Penguin, Two-Face and Harley Quinn.
