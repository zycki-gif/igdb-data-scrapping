Exploration in open-world style with the strenght of enemies and players limiting the movement to only same-or-lower level fights. \n \nCharacters can craft various gear to help in their quest, and this is also the main way to gain power. Level increase through battle unlocks more equipment tiers, wich in turn unlocks powers and bigger stats. A level 20 naked character will more or less fight at the same level of a naked level 1 character. \n \nCrafting gear happens at crafting stations where the player can combine over 20 different materials with gear blueprints to get a combination of bonuses unique to that particular combination. A stone helm will need strength to handle, but will provide more protection than one made of magic crystals, wich in turn will be way more useful to increase the mana pool of the character.", "tags": [17, 21, 268435468, 268435487, 268435488], "themes": [17, 21], "updated_at": 1688832873, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doom-and-destiny-worlds", "videos": [41916, 41917], "websites": [154371, 157854, 157855, 157856, 157857, 157858, 157859, 157860, 157861, 300274, 300275], "checksum": "bf326d6f-34bc-ced2-a28f-6876d9045563", "language_supports": [362718, 362719, 362720, 362721, 362722, 362724, 362726, 362728, 362730, 362732, 362734, 362736, 362738, 362740, 362742, 362744, 362748, 362750, 362752, 362753, 720101, 720102, 720103, 720104]}, {"id": 185703, "age_ratings": [50251, 129641, 129652, 129653, 130415, 132502], "aggregated_rating": 0.0, "aggregated_rating_count": 1, "artworks": [105919, 105920, 105921, 105922], "category": 0, "cover": 297859, "created_at": 1639411565, "external_games": [2178579, 2235092, 2674628, 2684168, 2684209, 2684454, 2708268], "first_release_date": 1678752000, "game_modes": [1], "genres": [2, 9, 31, 32], "hypes": 2, "involved_companies": [216469], "keywords": [218, 223, 250, 422, 840, 962, 1204, 1629, 1697, 1903, 2202, 2426, 3534, 24235, 24875, 25496], "name": "The Wreck", "platforms": [6, 14, 48, 49, 130, 167, 169], "player_perspectives": [2], "release_dates": [477454, 477455, 477456, 477457, 477458, 477459, 477460], "screenshots": [703037, 703038, 703039, 703040, 703041, 703042], "similar_games": [236, 18011, 19817, 23733, 25222, 28070, 77529, 81275, 106992, 111253], "slug": "the-wreck", "storyline": "At 36, Junon\u2019s life is in pieces: her career has stalled, she\u2019s emotionally numb, and her personal life is falling apart.

After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport Gordon to Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to embark on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city.\nGordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her large pet robot D0g and gives him a \"Gravity Gun\", a weapon which allows Gordon to pick up and move any large object with ease. Black Mesa East soon comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are captured to be taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Gordon and Alyx are forced to take separate paths to Nova Prospekt; Gordon takes a detour through the town of Ravenholm, receiving help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon makes his way to a Resistance outpost. Gordon is provided with a Dune Buggy, which he uses to travel along a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt. Along the way, Gordon encounters frequent Combine patrols, and helps one of the resistance leaders, Colonel Odessa Cubbage, to defend a Resistance base from a Combine gunship.\nAfter crossing an antlion-infested beach, Gordon enters Nova Prospekt, where he is reunited with Alyx. They manage to locate Eli, but also discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt.\nUpon reaching Kleiner's lab, a shaken Dr. Kleiner reveals to Gordon and Alyx that they were caught in a \"slow teleport\", during which a week had passed. In their absence, the Resistance, who heard about what had happened at Nova Prospekt, has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, and Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber that destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and allowing Gordon to escape and dispatch platoons of Combine soldiers.\nEventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine, contrary to what he had told Dr. Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen teleports them off-world. Dr. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon pursues him and destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen appears to be annihilated in the resulting explosion. Just before Gordon and Alyx are presumably met with a similar fate, time is frozen. The G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Making vague mention of \"offers for [Gordon's] services\", the G-Man places him back into stasis.", "summary": "1998.

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.", "tags": [1, 21, 268435489, 536870928, 536871306, 536871470, 536871599, 536871872, 536872070, 536872205, 536872349, 536872352, 536872594, 536872617, 536873064, 536873328, 536873390, 536873991, 536875046, 536875074, 536875151, 536875209, 536875312, 536875350, 536875396, 536875404, 536875434, 536875435, 536875453, 536875525, 536875666, 536875781, 536875802, 536875830, 536876005, 536876087, 536876272, 536876329, 536876354, 536876362, 536876435, 536876545, 536876642, 536876656, 536876713, 536876714, 536876715, 536876716, 536876718, 536877402, 536877417, 536877940, 536879069, 536879198, 536880573, 536881007, 536881084, 536882701, 536882765, 536885038, 536885573, 536894845, 536898541, 536900683, 536901279, 536901402], "themes": [1, 21], "total_rating": 78.39694361982939, "total_rating_count": 231, "updated_at": 1688822167, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-man", "videos": [57662], "websites": [3746, 94670, 305526, 332840], "checksum": "24938abf-1d1f-5c80-f308-1b65e5634805", "remakes": [20900, 65001, 178228, 178408], "remasters": [175992], "expanded_games": [62959, 63639, 88904, 134152, 214358], "ports": [7559, 68344, 133878, 172431, 172487, 198842, 200339, 204385, 204387, 205614, 213899, 213903, 213915, 213917, 213918, 213920, 213921, 213922, 213923, 213924, 213925, 213926, 213944, 214353, 214357, 214359, 214362, 214363, 218432, 218442, 218443, 219012, 219013, 219343, 219347, 219349, 219353, 219354, 219358, 219361, 219374, 219385, 219387, 219388, 219441, 219443, 219445, 219446, 219448, 219449, 219450, 241905], "language_supports": [686368], "game_localizations": [158]}, {"id": 2646, "age_ratings": [601, 145557], "aggregated_rating": 52.5, "aggregated_rating_count": 3, "bundles": [220258], "category": 3, "collection": 1323, "cover": 209870, "created_at": 1374354247, "external_games": [128437, 1747729], "first_release_date": 1190073600, "follows": 1, "franchises": [575, 892, 4047], "game_modes": [1, 2], "genres": [33], "involved_companies": [86766, 86767], "keywords": [960, 2152], "name": "Namco Museum DS", "platforms": [20], "rating": 79.0, "rating_count": 1, "release_dates": [179037], "screenshots": [27883], "similar_games": [15827, 25905, 27378, 61571, 87150, 87728, 90788, 90965, 103018, 239313], "slug": "namco-museum-ds", "summary": "A collection of Namco classics for the Nintendo DS.", "tags": [268435489, 536871872, 536873064], "total_rating": 65.75, "total_rating_count": 4, "updated_at": 1688822167, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/namco-museum-ds", "websites": [122566, 563160], "checksum": "663b1447-e8f1-cf57-bcf7-949c7a37471b"}, {"id": 154535, "age_ratings": [50324, 107415, 114627, 117412, 124549], "artworks": [40451], "category": 0, "cover": 156892, "created_at": 1625263024, "external_games": [2069822, 2119792, 2176872, 2183785, 2588586, 2624486], "first_release_date": 1579132800, "game_modes": [1], "genres": [12, 31], "name": "The Surge 2: Premium Edition", "platforms": [49], "release_dates": [311224], "screenshots": [511820, 511821, 511822, 511823, 511824, 511825, 511826, 511827, 511828, 511829], "similar_games": [25311, 55038, 55199, 81249, 86477, 96217, 105269, 106987, 107318, 115280], "slug": "the-surge-2-premium-edition", "summary": "Welcome to Jericho City.\n\nExplore the devastated metropolis and fight its numerous, ferocious threats in unforgiving combat.

While on work detail, Dan testifies about the Earth Defense Force's (EDF) cruelty to the Martian people and asks Alec to join the Red Faction, of which Dan is a member. Dan is soon after gunned down by air support from an EDF assault team. Alec is rescued by Red Faction guerrillas and reluctantly becomes a freedom fighter for the group alongside avid inventor \"Sam\" Samanya, rambling psychotic Randy Jenkins, and commander Hugo Davies(although in the game known as RF commander) Between Davies's command and Alec's skill and bravery, the EDF are quickly driven out of the sector known as Parker.\n\nThe campaign against the EDF continues in the Dust sector, and Alec is eventually assigned to routine surveillance of the Marauders, a mysterious and violent warrior tribe living in the inhospitable Badlands, in hopes of recovering stolen weapons. Alec tracks them to an abandoned Ultor base that promptly comes under massive assault from the EDF. During the fracas, Alec escapes with a device called the Nano Forge. This brings attention to Admiral Kobel, commander of a powerful warship called the Hydra, along with General Roth, commander of the EDF forces on Mars, who declares Alec Mason an outlaw. General Roth turns his attention to Dust and the EDF responds by pulling out of the sector and ordering the artillery base in the Free Fire Zone to bomb Dust into oblivion. Alec is tasked with saving members of the Red Faction and intel on the EDF from the bombardment, which he succeeds in doing.\n\nAlec temporarily loses faith in the movement, citing that no matter how determined their efforts are, the EDF will simply bomb them to submission. However, Sam analyzes the Nano Forge and discovers it can create catastrophic nanites that can disintegrate any object. She builds a prototype rifle from the device and entrusts it to Alec's care.\n\nAfter determining a series of blind spots in its coverage a successful run against an EDF artillery base commences, allowing the group to begin take the fight to EDF territories, The Red Faction prepares to launch a massive coordinated offensive against the EDF. Consequently, the EDF stages an assault against the Red Faction, resulting in the abortion of the offensive, the annihilation of the Badlands camp and the death of Commander Davies. Only Sam, Alec and a handful of other fighters survive the assault. They learn afterward that the Hydra is nearing Mars, with Kobel intending to use its firepower to put an end to the Red Faction and, if necessary, all planetary life. Sam declares that they need support from the Marauders if their campaign is to continue. When Alec remains dubious, she reveals that she was a Marauder herself. The pair head to a Marauder stronghold to meet with their ruler, Vasha, Sam's sister. Sam requests the usage of the Marauders' particle accelerator technology, with plans to combine it with the Nano Forge, creating a weapon capable of destroying the Hydra. Vasha agrees to let the Red Faction use their technology in exchange for possession of the Nano Forge once the war is finished.\n\nAfter capturing a broadcasting station and using it to regroup the Red Faction, Sam and Alec lead the remaining Red Faction and Marauders on a final assault on EDF Central Command. The two groups converge on Mt. Vogel to assemble the machine, however a surprise EDF blitzkrieg led by General Roth wipes out the Marauders guarding the summit end of the accelerator and Vasha along with them. Alec storms the mountain with a modified missile-pod tank, defeating General Roth's army and killing Roth. Sam's plan succeeds and the accelerated Nano Forge is successful in vaporizing the Hydra. As the survivors of Mars celebrate, Sam declares the war over, but Alec responds that the EDF will return, stating \"We'll be ready for 'em\". Alec and Sam approach the crowds of civilians gathered, and Alec raises his hammer in the air, showing the sign of the Red Faction and their long-waited victory.", "summary": "Set 50 years after the climactic events of the original Red Faction, Red Faction: Guerrilla allows players to take the role of an insurgent fighter with the newly re-established Red Faction movement as they battle for liberation from the oppressive Earth Defense Force.

Emerging from the chaos, a tormented figure awakens. You are Jonathan E. Reid, a high-ranking military surgeon transformed into a vampire upon his return home from the frontline.\n\nExplore the darkly atmospheric streets of early 20th century London, and interact with a multitude of characters with their own identities and importance. Accept and fulfill the missions they give you, but don\u2019t forget: sooner or later, you will have to feed, and make a difficult choice... who will be your prey? Absolutely all characters in the game are potential victims of your vampiric lust. Carefully study the habits of your next victim, his or her relationships with other characters, and set up your strategy to feed, unnoticed: seduce them, change their daily habits, or make sure they end up alone in a dark street...\n\nBe careful who you choose to hunt, as they will be gone forever, and their death will impact in a meaningful way the world that surrounds you. Feeding on human blood will not just keep you \"alive\"; it will also unlock new vampiric powers to use.\n\nThere will be times when exploration and seduction will only get you so far, and you'll need to resort to engaging in Vampyr's dynamic real-time combat. It blends hard-hitting melee combat with ranged shooting mechanics and the supernatural vampire powers. You'll face many types of enemies: different species of vampires and creatures, as well as vampire hunters who want to hunt you down with their weapons, tools and traps. In Vampyr, your health and the \"energy\" that drives your supernatural powers are one and same! Using powers will drain your own blood, giving you an edge in battle but also leaving you weaker. You will have to find a way to feed during combat to replenish your strength.\n\nVampyr also offers a deep crafting system. Find and loot materials and components from the fresh corpses of your victims or during exploration, in order to craft and improve tools, melee and ranged weapons, as well as special ammunitions and coating to exploit the weaknesses of your enemies.\n\nAs you cling to what remains of your humanity, your decisions will ultimately shape the fate of your hero while searching for answers in the coughing, foggy aftermath of the Spanish Flu.", "summary": "London, 1918.

Freyda is tasked to retrieve the young prince Andrei, and is sent on a chase to the home of the Dwarves, Tor-Hrall. There, Laszlo, Freyda's ally attacks the Dwarves while Freyda is at council with them. However, because of Wulfstan's kind heart, Freyda is let free. From this point on, Freyda no longer fights for her queen. She learns that her father has been kidnapped and rallies the help of Duncan, who assist her in getting a vessel to safely transport her to the empire.\n\nThe attack on Tor-Hrall leave the Dwarves slightly shaken. Wulfstan and his brother Rolf have opposing views, and thus Rolf allies himself with the Queen, while Wulfstan fights his own battles. As a result of this civil strife, Wulfstan ends up facing many Dwarves, however, plenty of those Dwarves tend to rally to his aid after realizing their own mistakes. As a result, Wulfstan's influence amongst the Dwarves grows. Eventually Wulfstan teams up with his friend Duncan and together they set a distraction to ensure the safety of Freyda's voyage. The city of Tor-Hrall is now recaptured in the name of Wulfstan. Soon after that, Laszlo is killed.\n\nYlaya is a Keeper of the Law and is told by the Daughter of Malassa to find out what rituals are being practiced by the Soulscar clan that do not heed Malassa herself. When Ylaya is discovered, she flees and seeks one who has been gone for many a month - Raelag. She finds him with Isabel and discovers that this Isabel is the real Isabel and the Queen is actually the succubus Biara, who has been spared on several occasions already. After making an alliance with Black Dragons, Ylaya brings down a great portion of the Soulscar clan, and the Dark Elf clans can thus be temporarily at peace. While that peace lasts, Ylaya and Raelag have one less enemy. Before the final battle, Raelag splits off from the group to achieve something that is to help in the war. Ylaya, Freyda, Duncan, Wulfstan and Isabel all meet up and combine forces to capture Tor-Hrall once and for all. King Tolghar is killed during the battle and the Empire's forces are seen retreating. After the climactic battle, it is revealed that Archbishop Alaric will still serve Biara.

Mike Powell, the protagonist, is a skilled U.S. Army Ranger and later an agent of the Office of Strategic Services. Powell and a squad of Rangers are in Arzew, Algeria, fighting on the North African front. The squad fight their way into the city, but an ambush kills all the team except Powell. Powell continues into a North African Axis base, where he rescues S.A.S. agent Major Grillo and retrieves his equipment. The major and Lieutenant Powell split up, with Grillo securing transport, while Powell does sabotage in a motor pool. He then links back up with Grillo, who has commandeered a jeep with a mounted machinegun. The two then drive to a German airfield, where they successfully destroy the Stuka dive bombers grounded there. While Grillo distracts the German forces, Powell sneaks into a bunker, cuts off Axis radio contact and fights his way to a coastal lighthouse to signal the Allied fleet to begin the invasion of Africa. He escapes with Grillo then in the jeep.  \n  \nFollowing the Allies' success in Africa, Powell and Grillo are sent to German-occupied Norway to infiltrate the city of Trondheim, where a Kriegsmarine U-Boat is being outfitted with a prototype Naxos radar detector. Grillo makes it into the base first, but is killed by German guards while opening the front gate for Powell. Powell fights his way into the base, then he disguises himself as a German soldier and infiltrates the loading dock. He first goes to the lab where he destroys the Naxos prototype. Next, Powell gains access to a submarine intended to be fitted with the prototype and blows it up, then escapes into the air ducts. He then fights his way out of the base, where he is extracted by an Allied squad.  \n  \nThanks to Powell's efforts, the German U-Boat threat is neutralized, clearing the way for the Allied invasion of Europe. Powell is sent to Omaha Beach under Capt. Ramsay, where he and his fellow Rangers storm the bunkers, despite taking heavy casualties, and secure the beach. He is then sent into the countryside beyond the beaches to assist various American units who are being harassed by Nebelwerfers.  \n  \nPowell is then assigned to go behind enemy lines and acquire intelligence on German troop movements. After rescuing a stranded British pilot Joe Baylor, Powell meets up with French Resistance member Manon Batiste (the protagonist of Medal of Honor: Underground). She sends him out to conduct various acts of sabotage against the German war effort. He then raids a manor house being used as a command post where he secures important enemy documents, including the blueprints for the new King Tiger tank. Powell then escapes the manor house with Manon's aid.  \n  \nPowell's next mission involves hijacking a King Tiger tank and using it to secure a vital bridge at the city of Brest. After navigating through the sniper-infested ruins, he meets up with the American tank crew chosen for the mission. Powell and the tank crew capture the King Tiger and use it to fight their way through the countryside. Upon reaching Brest, Powell provides cover for the King Tiger to protect the bridge, until reinforcements come to secure it.  \n  \nPowell's final mission sends him to Fort Schmerzen, a German mustard gas-producing facility that was previously raided by Lieutenant James Patterson, but has since been restored to operation, supposedly as a POW camp, but is possibly being used to produce mustard gas. Powell is parachuted into the woods, where he destroys some Flak 88s harassing Allied planes. He then infiltrates a weapons depot, and destroys a stockpile of StG 44 assault rifle and then destroys a German communications outpost, cutting off Fort Schmerzen's communications. Powell then hijacks a freight train and along with a squad of US Rangers, uses it to reach Schmerzen. Upon arriving at Schmerzen, Powell and his fellow Rangers storm the fort and release all the POWs.

Those that don't drown will reach the forsaken shores of Wraeclast, where the only welcome is the clinging embrace of undeath. However, a small band of survivors has managed to hold fast in a ruined lighthouse, desperately repelling both the grasping undead and the manic scavengers that stubbornly cling to their last shreds of humanity. Under the commanding gaze of Axiom Prison, snarling goatmen roam the craggy bluffs, always keeping their cloven feet well clear of the rhoa-infested swamps in the lowlands. All along the coast, rotting shipwrecks litter the shoreline, the spirits of the stranded sailors still haunting the wreckages of their ill-fated ships, waiting to take out their sorrow and rage on those who yet live. All the while, the Siren herself continues her sweet, sad song, luring ever more ships to their watery graves.\n\nFarther inland, through the twisting caves and darkened forests, the ruins of civilisation become more apparent. The ravages of time have worn many buildings to rubble, and stripped away decaying flesh, leaving only grotesquely grinning bones. The dark, fetid caves and underground passages are a clattering refuge for these skeletal ranks, while the open forests and riverways brim with monstrous beasts with a taste for blood. Recently, ragtag groups of bloodthirsty bandits have built fortified camps in the forest, openly challenging one another while extorting food and supplies from the small, struggling village that sits between them atop a stone dam. Ignored by the squabbling bandits, strange newcomers clad in black armor have been seen skulking around various large ruins, their purpose both mysterious yet unsettling.\n\nAtop a sheer cliff of ruptured mantle, straddling the river feeding a mighty waterfall, lies the fallen capital of the Eternal Empire. Its former glory rots amid the ruins of a blasted cityscape, the buildings decrepit and mouldering. But Sarn is far from uninhabited. Many of the original citizens still lurk the dark recesses, their humanity washed clean by the cataclysm of centuries past. These Undying monsters roam the city at night and skulk the shadows during the day, for the naked sunlight is anathema to their shrivelled, leathery skin. The sun-scarred days are far from peaceful, however. A legion of soldiers from Oriath has occupied the area to the west of the river, and is fighting an all-out war against the multifarious denizens of the city. Every day their black-clad soldiers battle twisted insects that scuttle and breed, feasting on anything that moves. Every day they throw battalions against the army of floating, red Ribbons that eviscerate all who trespass on their domain. Every day they skirmish against a small group of exiles who have barricaded themselves on a small island in the middle of the river, caught between certain death on both sides.", "summary": "You are an Exile, struggling to survive on the dark continent of Wraeclast, as you fight to earn power that will allow you to exact your revenge against those who wronged you.

If ever the romantic notions of being a spy actually excited, it was probably with the OSS. Young men and women, often recruited right out of college, entered into the cloak and dagger world of wartime intelligence. It was an exciting and dangerous time, and as the war grew so did the mission of the OSS. Sabotage, search & rescue and subversion all became part of the organisation's daily operation.\n\nThat's when a young Lieutenant in the Air Transport Corps entered the picture and changed the OSS forever. On June 5, 1944 - the night before the D-Day invasion - the largest aerial drop of troops in history up to that point was launched by the Allied command. It was an unmitigated disaster.

Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.\n\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker\u2014who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum.

Unfortunately his vehicle got severely damaged and crashes in a jungle of Titan. He wakes up after a while, finds a gun and retrieves a holocube later on. His own hologram tells he is Conrad B. Hart, and he has to go find Ian in New Washington, telling he's not safe. After a little journey in the jungle, he meets Bolton, and asks to find his teleporter for medical assistance. After retrieving the teleporter, he teleports as he leaves his own ID card. After venturing for a while, Conrad meets Joe, he tells that New Washington is down the hole behind him, but an Anti-Gravity Belt is needed. To have it, he asks for several Grenada fruits. After swapping what they both want, Conrad jumps into the hole and activates the belt to safely arrive in New Washington.\n\nNear Ian's place, he overhears a Cyborg interrogating him about a neurophage. After saving him, he gives a part of his memory back and gives a force field to protect him from bullets. Conrad then checks his GBI Virtual Reality with a virtual professor, who mocks him and tells him his own cryptic location. He finds a Memory Flash at the place, to find out about a deal with aliens in disguise in Death Tower. Conrad asks Joe a new identity for the Death Tower TV show. Joe tells the cost is 1500 credits, and points out the Administration Center to get a Work Permit for a salary. He uses Bolton's ID card to get a Work Permit. After doing his first job, he gets another Memory Flash, about a meeting between him and the real professor, telling him the Earth is being quietly invaded by aliens nicknamed Morphs. He then talks about a neurophage that he made to destroy them all. As he performs other jobs, he finds other pieces of his memory back as well as instructions to find the neurophage and its activator. With all the salary he got from performing jobs, he buys what he wanted from Joe, and enters the Death Tower TV show as Jay Carpenter.\n\nAfter winning the show and getting a ticket to Earth, Conrad talks to the announcer about finishing up the deal. The disguised morph then reveals they have the new senator and Sonia, Conrad's girlfriend, and awaits them to be absorbed by The Mind. After killing the announcer, he uses the ticket to Earth to save Sonia and the planet.\n\nEventually, he is arrested in Earth's spaceport by corrupted cyborg cops, but manages to get out. He meets Ian again, who says that erasing his own memory to fool them didn't work, reminding him that he gave his first flashback, and reveals that he's a Morph, and the Morphs' goal: To perfect humanity as being a powerful entity. He gives to Conrad his painful last Flashback: showing that he had a very risky plan to go to the Morphs' homeworld. He then drives a jetbike, and asks Bolton where is the senator, and talks about the Paradise Club. When he goes there, he witnesses a meeting between the senator and the Morphs, who absorbed him, and talks about the Earth's colonisation. The vent where he stands for fell by his weight and is imprisoned by them. He manages to escape and meets Ian once more, and kills him. He finds a teleporter which leads him to their homeworld.\n\nAfter being teleported, he frees the professor from his prison, and tells Conrad to get rid of an auxiliary brain so he can save Sonia. After that, he tells him to destroy The Mind, and use the neurophage in the planet's core. As he meets The Mind, it tries to persuade Conrad into being absorbed by him, only to get mocked at, and says he prefers being himself. After destroying it, Conrad releases the neurophage. As he tells Sonia that he's sorry, the professor tells Conrad to run as there is a spacecraft not far away.\n\nConrad manages to leave the Morph Planet alive as it explodes with the spacecraft. He tries to find where he is in the map, only to find out that his position is unknown. Unhappy, as he goes to his room, his holocube shows a hologram of Conrad congratulating him. Conrad then enters into suspended animation as the spacecraft goes. The credits shows the cutscenes, including one when the suspended animation ends as he wakes up. The post-credits cutscene is a discussion between some of the characters, with Sonia feeling that Conrad is still alive.", "summary": "Flashback is a science fiction platform video game remake of the original 1992 Flashback.
