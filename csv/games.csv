Etna, one of the castle vassals, is standing next to him, surrounded by various weapons. She explains that he has been sleeping for two years, far longer than he intended, and his father, King Krichevskoy, has died. Laharl vows to reclaim the throne, and, after consulting with Etna and his other vassals, goes to Vyers' castle.

After defeating the demon Vyers, who refers to himself as the ""Dark Adonis"" and is renamed ""Mid-Boss"" by Laharl, he meets Angel Trainee Flonne. Flonne had been sent to the Netherworld by Seraph Lamington, the ruler of Celestia, to assassinate King Krichevskoy (who was already dead). Shocked by Laharl's lack of grief at his father's death, the eternally optimistic Flonne joins Laharl's party to determine if demons are capable of feeling love. Observing them in secret is the paranoid Archangel Vulcanus, who interprets Flonne's actions as treason and is convinced that she is plotting against him.

After Etna demands that Laharl pay the salary of the Prinnies that she has hired, he decides to attack the demon with the most money in the vicinity. This is Hoggmeiser at Dinero Palace. After defeating Hoggmeiser, Laharl is about to kill him, until Hoggmeiser's son rushes out and gets in the way. Flonne convinces Laharl to spare them, and Laharl lets them keep some of the money. In response to this act, Hoggmeiser joins the party.

At one point, Flonne and Etna discover a photograph of Laharl in an embarrassing situation. Laharl refers to this as a ""paparazzi shot"", however, the actual contents of the photo are never actually revealed. A threat on the back of the photograph states that copies of it would be distributed if Laharl did not accept a challenge to fight for the overlordship; thus Laharl was blackmailed.

Responding to this challenge, Laharl meets Maderas, a vampire. He was banished by King Krichevskoy, for stealing the King's favorite snack, black pretzels. Maderas takes advantage of Laharl's two biggest weaknesses – optimism and women with sexy bodies. Maderas was also controlling Etna by holding her memory. He had instructed her to kill the prince, but she had put him to sleep for two years by poisoning him instead. Etna eventually betrays Maderas, and along with Laharl, Flonne, and Mid-Boss, defeats him.","[102562, 102563]",Disgaea 1 Complete,disgaea-1-complete,0617b14d-14e4-f0c7-a93c-eba6667c0c47,7.0,"[21026, 21027, 21938, 33398]",,"[210746, 210747, 210748, 389782, 389783, 389784]",[1],"[1, 17, 27]",[12121],"[395113, 505159, 541999, 1315478, 1594236, 1603246, 1930224, 1930581, 1934325, 1936569, 1999550, 2086859, 2087123, 2173126, 2220738, 2225771, 2579968, 2585034, 2596631]","[496848, 496850]","[80835, 131609, 131610, 145020, 145021, 145022, 174171, 174172, 174173, 259197]",72.26118500604595,,[2054],,"[34, 39, 48, 130]",1516290594,1688760758,34392.0,3.0,,,"[10179, 20548]",987.0,,1532563200.0,,"[13196, 24426, 25311, 26574, 26845, 27092, 27209, 35994, 96217, 119171]",,,76.38059250302297,6.0,1.0,"[154016, 154017, 154018, 154019, 155313, 155314, 155315, 155316, 157772, 157773, 201146, 342275]",82373,,"A version of Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, including the added content in Afternoon of Darkness and Disgaea PC, was released for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on October 9, 2018, retitled as Disgaea 1 Complete.

To escape, you must explore the sinister castle for puzzles and plot your escape together. Secrets and riddles are hidden in the shadows. Just be aware that nothing is what it seems in this mysterious Antarctic adventure. Can you two escape together, or will you be trapped… forever?

Locked up in the dungeons, deep in the bowels of Castle Rock, you and a fellow prisoner must seek a way out and return to stand again beneath the icy Antarctic skies - but escaping this nightmare will not be so easy, let alone escaping the castle itself. Freeing yourselves from your cells and escaping the Keep is only the beginning - but does one truly escape Castle Rock? Fresh mysteries await, and you’ll have to make some choices about how to proceed. Your journey leads from the dark prison through the royal halls to the outside. Outside the Keep, you will discover the story of Rockbury, it’s inhabitants, and plans of a resistance formed against the King to escape this icy place. Hope will lead you on to an eerie Graveyard and have you descend down into the dark waters of the Foundry.

You two have been brought here for a purpose. You might even be the missing piece of a puzzle set in motion long ago, in a time long forgotten. But someone, or something, desperately seeks to solve that puzzle, by any means necessary. Only an unshakeable bond with your partner will give you any hope of survival in the face of such dreadful desire…

Rool, aboard his vessel, The Flying Krock, commands his minions to invade the island and take Donkey captive so that his next attempt at stealing the banana hoard will not be a failure and the hero will never mess with his plans again. Donkey, still lounging, did not notice the attack until Kutlasses ambushed him and took him prisoner. Kaptain K. Rool assures Donkey Kong that he will never see his precious island or his friends again.

Later and back on the island, Diddy, Dixie and Cranky Kong find Donkey missing, along with a note. It reads:

Donkey's grandfather, Cranky Kong, rushes inside the treehouse to tell Donkey Kong to wake up so he may tell him what happened. He then tells Donkey to check his Banana Cave. Donkey Kong is infuriated, exclaiming that the Kremlings will pay for stealing his banana hoard and kidnapping his little buddy. Donkey goes on to say that he will hunt every corner of the island for his bananas back.","[154591, 175782, 175783]",Donkey Kong Country,donkey-kong-country,d2916128-0612-25ce-f538-5a4dc0faec4a,453.0,"[31634, 60123, 62125]",,"[9404, 9405, 9406, 401848, 401849, 401850, 401851, 401852, 401853, 401854, 401855, 401856]","[1, 2, 3]",[1],"[85432, 85433, 85434, 85435, 85436, 85437, 85438, 85439, 85440, 85441, 85442, 85443, 87513]","[57094, 73074, 142701, 217166, 245284, 1933116, 2594483, 2596110]","[473598, 473599, 473600, 473601]","[11550, 123204, 513990, 514000]",85.15498807291236,"[152752, 162835]",[763],,"[5, 19, 41, 58, 137]",1340040780,1688760056,,1.0,,,[163],6066.0,"[15885, 15886, 15887]",785116800.0,[150028],"[358, 843, 1068, 1092, 1094, 1185, 1186, 1528, 2148, 16326]",,,82.41082736978952,128.0,,"[3347, 138856, 138857, 138858, 138859, 138860, 322011, 322012, 322013, 322014, 322015, 322016, 336939, 379380, 379381]",1090,,"Donkey Kong Country is a side scrolling platformer by British developers Rare in 1994.

Players can enjoy a seemingly endless supply of inventive Mario levels from players around the world.

The game includes a book totaling about 100 pages that illustrates the boundless possibilities in Super Mario Maker. Nintendo will also release two special Mario amiibo figures to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros. game. Tapping these amiibo in Super Mario Maker adds a Big Mushroom power-up to your course, allowing Mario to grow big and bust blocks from any direction, as well as adding a retro visual filter to the game, reminiscent of older cathode ray tube televisions. In addition, many other amiibo will also be compatible with Super Mario Maker through the use of a new item called the Mystery Mushroom. This item allows Mario to take the appearance of many other characters, such as Link, Kirby or Wii Fit Trainer, complete with character-specific animations and sound effects. These character costumes can be unlocked by completing the 100 Mario Challenge mode and many can also be unlocked if the player taps the amiibo of the character to the Wii U GamePad."

Now, as a string of murders casts a shroud over the city and the law begins to fail, justice cannot afford to be blind.

The son of a murdered lawyer, Takayuki Yagami was raised on the streets of Kamurocho by a yakuza patriarch who paves the way for Yagami to follow in his real father's footsteps. Taking a job at the Genda Law Office, Yagami accepts a high-profile case: Proving Shinpei Okubo, a man suspected of murder, innocent.

Against all odds, Yagami succeeds and is hailed as a hero, but his prolific career is short-lived. Only months later, Okubo brutally murders his girlfriend, stabbing her over ten times with a kitchen knife before setting their apartment on fire.

Yagami becomes the lawyer who let a murderer walk - and everything he had worked for comes crashing down.

Three years later, Yagami has taken off his lawyer's badge to run a small detective agency in the red-light district of Kamurocho, scraping by on odd jobs and evidence collection.

But even a city as seedy as this is shaken by a string of serial murders, where the victims' bodies are discovered with their eyes gouged out. Yagami is drawn into the case by his old law firm, where he discovers that in order to bring this killer to light, he must seek the truth that slipped from his grasp three years ago. But can a man haunted by his failures prevail over his own past?","[75348, 124295]",Judgment,judgment,b63904e6-72f2-f1f6-9c23-3e64075fcaa4,57.0,"[25314, 26003, 28256, 28372]",,"[244562, 244564, 244566, 244567, 244569, 314328, 314329, 314330, 314331, 314332, 322420, 322421]",[1],"[1, 20, 31, 43]","[5349, 5351, 5352, 5353]","[1592664, 1593261, 1614946, 1700627, 1865742, 1865817, 1929696, 1934517, 1935296, 1936069, 1937991, 1997971, 1997979, 1998001, 1998005, 1998025, 2001719, 2001723, 2001906, 2002000, 2083363, 2084965, 2086471, 2086842, 2087250, 2087414, 2088047, 2175718, 2181956, 2445816, 2452703, 2586500, 2586895, 2586999, 2589305, 2604059]","[54134, 54135, 54136, 54137, 54138, 54139, 54140, 54141, 54142, 54143, 54144, 54145, 54146, 54147, 54148, 54149, 54150, 54151, 54152, 54153, 161902, 161904, 161906, 161912, 161914]","[101965, 104270, 109977, 109978, 109979, 110006, 311751, 350982]",83.0242925667554,,[1467],[391],"[6, 48, 167, 169, 170]",1536578142,1688756064,,18.0,,,"[53, 54]",7649.0,,1544659200.0,,"[17548, 27092, 55199, 55984, 80916, 96217, 103266, 106987, 107614, 116530]",,,82.86928914052055,14.0,,"[158194, 158195, 166029, 166030, 227093, 227094, 227095, 389350]",109274,,"Judgment is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective.

In the game's history, around the seventh or eighth centuries a small number of humans took on bestial traits. The majority of humans feared these half breeds and war broke out. Despite the humans outnumbering the half breeds, their animal strength gave them the upper hand in centuries of conflict.
Centuries later, humanity finds new hope in King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. King Arthur and his like-minded knights take the fight to the half breeds, but Arthur soon realizes it's a losing battle. Through a mysterious turn of fate The Knights discover Black Water, a mystical liquid that significantly extends their lifetimes and gives them remarkable healing abilities. Despite this new advantage the half breeds continue to win battle after battle, until the industrial Revolution turns the tide. Inventors are far ahead of their time, inventing technologies such as thermal imaging, Zeppelins, and wireless communications. New weapons belch electricity, ignite clouds of molten metal on top of enemies, and fulfil dual functions as Fragmentation grenades and proximity mines.
By 1886, the war still goes on, but the humans almost have martial law. A new threat emerges in the form of the lower classes rebelling against the rich and the social order, with the Knights supporting the well-to-do upper classes and nobles. The game features four main protagonists from the same squad, who each has a given name, and the adopted name of one of the original Knights. The oldest is Sebastian Mallory, the second to bear the name of Sir Percival, and the descendant of Thomas Mallory, who in the 1400s wrote Le Morte d'Arthur, the definitive Arthurian Text. A close friend of Grayson, he is one of the best Knights in the history of the order.
Grayson is the third to bear the title of Sir Galahad, and has battled the order's enemies for centuries. He views Mallory as a mentor, Lafayette as a friend, and Isabeau as a potential love interest. Other than that, little is known about him so far. Isabeau D'Argyll is one of the younger Knights in the order, but is much older than her appearance of being in her late twenties. The latest Lady Igraine, Isabeau was Grayson's apprentice and if not for her commitment to the order, his lover. Marquis de Lafayette was a French military officer who fought in the French and American Revolutions. His tactical expertise brought him to the order's attention, and Mallory approached him and convinced him to join the order. Although the group's youngest, his globetrotting has given him a whimsical outlook on life that grounds the squad. As an apprentice, he does not yet bear the name of a Knight.","[8391, 181895, 181896]",The Order: 1886,the-order-1886,a1257f7f-fcc4-ccc4-abbc-f246b5789ca9,206.0,"[2640, 2824, 6107]",,"[5870, 5871, 5872, 5873, 5874]","[1, 2]","[1, 17, 19, 22]","[4800, 4801, 4802, 4803, 4804, 4805, 4806, 4807, 4808, 4809, 4810, 6233]","[55045, 83724, 118023, 189015, 246075, 401279, 1930592, 1932909, 1934461, 1936402, 1938220, 2087845, 2175257, 2450266, 2453864, 2580764, 2582805]",,"[1051, 162282, 333309]",69.02886074698061,,,[183],[48],1382280955,1688755958,,14.0,,,,,,1424390400.0,,"[512, 1887, 1939, 1941, 1985, 2031, 3025, 7331, 7334, 105049]",,,65.76443037349031,69.0,11.0,"[23469, 106275, 106276]",3048,,"The Order: 1886 introduces players to a unique vision of Victorian-Era London where Man uses advanced technology to battle a powerful and ancient foe.

""When the Spring loses its power and the world heads for destruction, Heroes from other worlds shall arrive. The Heroes will share their power with the shrines and revive the Spring. And the one who leads the Heroes will be crowned as the new Monarch, and restore glory to the world.""

Featuring all of the surgeries and twisted humour of the original favourite, this is one surgical experience you will never want to forget!

Be transported into some of the most unlikely and possibly unsanitary surgeries possible with a totally new control system – you can no longer blame the keyboard or gamepad this time – this is on YOU, Dr Burke.

With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to their role as an explosives expert (codenamed ""Alias"") as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth.

Eventually, the research is successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. However, fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down, executed, and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as ""The Processed"". Collectively betrayed by their leader, the player's squad flees underground and ally themselves with the Red Faction as mercenaries. The Red Faction at this point in the story is an organized resistance movement that is strongly opposed to the rule of Sopot and the skewed political tenets of The Commonwealth. The squad eventually pursues Sopot and neutralizes all opposition in their way as the Red Faction takes the conflict to the streets in a joint uprising against the rule of The Commonwealth. During the initial stages of the game, the Red Faction and the squad mutually support each other as they overcome shared objectives such as sabotaging propaganda installations. The uprising culminates in successfully trapping Sopot in his missile silo and executing him.

Alias returns to the makeshift base of operations only to discover that all of the Red Faction resistance members present have been brutally slaughtered. The squad's leader, Molov, remarks that with Sopot dead and with the nanotech research in his possession, the Commonwealth's military forces have voluntarily pledged allegiance to him. He declares Alias and Tangier, a fellow squadmember, to be enemies of the state for supporting the Red Faction. Tangier helps Alias escape, and shortly after fleeing to safety, Alias lends aid to surviving Red Faction members who are defending themselves from the enemy. Alias and Echo, another squadmember, meet up in a secret location to discuss an alternate strategy to stop Molov, and Echo is killed in action during a firefight with Quill, a former squadmember. Tangier radios Alias soon afterward, and the two agree to shut down Molov's commandeered nanotech laboratory located within the colossal statue of Sopot. Inside the laboratory, Alias triumphs over Repta, a former squadmember, and destroys the nanotech laboratory's power generators. Alias's explosives weaken the foundation of the statue and render it unstable. Alias encounters Repta again and once again triumphs over him, causing the energy field within Repta to reach critical mass.

Alias and Tangier meet up and pursue Molov, who is scaling Sopot's statue with the nanotech cell – the culmination of Capek's research – and awaiting extraction from Shrike, Molov's subordinate. Shrike betrays his commanding officer, and Tangier manages to reclaim the nanotech cell from Molov's possession. Molov, desperate to eliminate his enemies, climbs aboard a nearby battle armor and launches a frenzied assault against Alias. Using the destructible environment to his advantage, Alias manages to evade Molov's fire and launches a counterattack that not only kills Molov, but also destroys the statue. As the statue crumbles, Shrike swoops in with his close air support craft to extract Alias. From this point, the story ends in one of four possible ways, depending on the player's Heroics score.","[10582, 10584, 10585, 20456, 184138]",Red Faction II,red-faction-ii,e86fe023-bbcc-1121-e65a-fee82909b83d,48.0,[13205],,"[45592, 45593, 45594, 45595, 45596]","[1, 4]","[1, 18]",[55896],"[14537, 77837, 88869, 98310, 145890, 247378, 398953, 1748034, 2136353, 2161794, 2172324, 2223590, 2639107, 2678408, 2678794]","[345223, 475293]","[20764, 20765, 40514, 40515, 119470, 334566]",68.45902220046781,,,[135],"[6, 8, 11, 21, 48]",1390521790,1688755461,,4.0,,,,100.0,,1034640000.0,,"[41, 564, 1294, 1886, 2031, 5812, 8422, 8744, 55038, 103281]",,,74.4795111002339,18.0,,"[24182, 24183, 24184, 24185, 24186, 24187, 24188, 24189, 24190, 241976, 241977, 242139, 242258]",4083,,"In Red Faction II you will have to defend your country as Alias, a demolitions expert, with the help of your five squad members, each specializing in their own method of destruction.

“No, you’ve got it all wrong, I’ve been falsely accused! I’m innocent!”

“Sengoku Shunju. A name I will never forget. You killed my entire family. For that, I will never forgive you.”
Sengoku is in prison, charged with arson and murder—for burning to death 21 people, including Rina’s family.
Naturally, the victim does not believe a word of Sengoku’s claims of innocence.
Besides Sengoku are four other groups of criminals and their respective victims.

The accused criminals are called “Prisoners,” and the victims “Executioners.” Criminals and victims must pair up to face the amusement park’s attractions.

The Prisoners hope to overcome the challenges so that they may be pardoned.

The island is separated from the rest of society by freezing waters and constant, brutal storms. Upon their arrival, the detectives witness one of the hospital’s therapists falling out of the window to his death.

Shortly after starting their investigation, they learn that much darker things are going on at Mnemosyne Asylum. No one is willing to speak of the devastating fire, which engulfed the hospital four years ago, or the victims who died. The fact that the staff does everything they can in order to obscure the asylum’s story, makes everything even more suspicious.

Each clue uncovered only raises new questions. Who killed Doctor Crow? What caused one of the asylum’s male staff to lose his mind? Who is Zed Rascov? What connects the doctor’s death to the name of the little girl, Ginger, carved into the wood-paneled wall of his office?","[86213, 86214, 86215]",9 Clues 2: The Ward,9-clues-2-the-ward,2b0d952b-8e71-bfb5-c5b5-af0b1465489a,2.0,[30690],,"[84720, 84721, 84722, 84723, 84724]",[1],"[20, 35, 43]",[36558],"[8498, 110529, 1189830, 2605380, 2605412, 2605671, 2609177, 2636464]","[147204, 147206, 147207, 147209, 147211, 147213, 147214, 147215, 147216, 147217, 147218, 147219, 147220, 456384, 456385, 456386, 456387, 456388, 456389, 456391, 456393, 456395, 456396]","[37029, 121711, 512606]",80.0,,,[741],"[3, 6, 14, 34, 39, 48, 49, 74, 167, 169]",1495831044,1688755106,,,,,"[6717, 20019]",3955.0,,1410912000.0,,"[236, 18011, 25222, 26223, 27725, 54678, 55984, 81275, 107614, 121450]",,,80.0,2.0,,"[178207, 178208, 178209, 178210, 178212, 178213, 393848, 393849, 441843, 441844]",35265,,"9 Clues 2: The Ward is the second installment of Tap It Games' casual adventure series with hidden object puzzles, set in the 1950s America in which a young detective and her partner respond to a distress call from a psychiatric hospital on a secluded island."

With technology far beyond human comprehension, the discoverers of the astronaut use lasers to build physical replicas of the astronaut’s long-dead memories in hopes to understand what this strange creature was and why they are floating through space alone.

By controlling dual lasers with both analog sticks, players will:
-Collect Memory molecules scattered around the mysterious space ship
-Harmonize the Astronaut’s memories within the Astronaut’s metaphysical plane
-Warp back to reality through the Astronaut’s subconscious, avoiding mental blocks
-Energize the dead Astronaut so it can create physical manifestations of its memories
Laserlife is meant to be played in one sitting, so turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and get lost in this existential adventure about what it means to be a human.

Jump on your hoverboard and backflip into battle, or saddle up onto a mechanical moose and lead the charge. Whatever your play style, every LEAP mercenary is equipped with a Personal Vehicle (PV), allowing you to quickly cover distances and close the gap on your enemy.

Every exosuit comes equipped with match altering abilities - Call in an Orbital Laser to wipe out a group of enemies, or throw down a Support Shield to take temporary cover from enemy fire.

Every obstacle is an opportunity to soar, dash or charge, and an elite mercenary will use their unique movement abilities to navigate the battlefield quickly. Use your grappling hook to reach greater heights or your directional dash to dodge enemy fire.

Dr. Edward Richtofen is heard via a television, carrying out his scheme on the Moon. Richtofen seizes control of the zombies by entering the Aether, but Dr. Ludvig Maxis works with his daughter Samantha and Richtofen's former allies, Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masakai to thwart him. To this end, Maxis launches three massive nuclear missiles filled with Element 115, the element responsible for the reanimation of dead cells, at the Earth, destroying it. One missile completely destroys Nuketown and all present.
Years later, Earth has been reduced to a crumbling, hellish wasteland overrun by zombies. In this new world, four survivors - Samuel J. Stuhlinger, Abigail ""Misty"" Briarton, Marlton Johnson, and Russman - have banded together to survive in Washington with the help of a bus driven by a robotic driver. The four are contacted by Maxis, now an digitally-rendered A.I., who is seeking humanity's aid against Richtofen. Maxis implores them to power up a tower in a cornfield using an electricity-based zombie. However, Richtofen contacts Samuel, who is able to hear voices from the Aether, and commands him to convince his friends to power up the tower in his favor. The player may choose to follow either Maxis or Richtofen's orders. It is revealed in audio transmissions that survivors from all over the world have been contacted by both Maxis and Richtofen, though there is widespread conflict between the followers of both Germans; particularly in a settlement known as Jackass Flats, which was initially a safe haven, only to fall to the zombies when the Maxis-Richtofen conflict consumed it.
Regardless of who they choose to aid, the four are teleported to a crumbling skyline in Shanghai, China. Here, Richtofen commands Samuel to ""mend the rift"" and accept his fate as a follower of Richtofen, threatening to expose his past as a member of a cannibalistic cult known as The Flesh, who eat zombie flesh to survive. Richtofen continuously revives the group whenever they fall to the zombies until they follow his orders. Maxis, who is no longer hampered by electric devices, contacts the group again for aid. The four learn through televisions scattered across the area of the Flesh, as well as the beginnings of a new airborne plague of Element 115, the element that reanimates dead cells and causes zombies.
Following their battles in Shanghai, Russman leads the group across the continents to a large hole in the ground known as ""the Rift"" in Africa, hoping to find answers about the unseen forces commanding them. Maxis and Richtofen contact them once again, more desperate than ever to achieve their goals. Both of them ask the group to power up the third and final tower in their favor. Maxis promises to heal the Earth, and Richtofen promises to save them from Maxis. The four gain a new ally in the form of a mute, unnamed giant in a western town built underground, and are hampered by a ghostly woman in a massive mansion. Depending on who the player has aided in the story, there are two possible endings. If the player has aided Richtofen, he will gain unlimited power over the Aether and the Earth, kill Maxis and condemn Samantha Maxis' soul to eternal damnation. He will then enter the body of Samuel as a reward for his aid, but finds he cannot exit it, and is at the mercy of the zombies as he was before. If the player has aided Maxis, he uses the power from the towers to enter the Aether and assume ultimate control, trapping Richtofen in a zombie's body. However, the Earth begins shaking, and Maxis explains to the four that he is beginning the process of the destruction of the Earth and humanity to reach Agartha, where he believes Samantha is.
Unbeknownst to all, Samantha is indeed in Agartha (which her father ultimately fails to enter) but reaches out to her father in 1918 France during World War I. Maxis is a leader of Group 935, who operate to secure Germany's victory in the war. To this end, they have created towering mechanical robots, suits of armor, and staffs that control the powers of the elements. Group 935 also stumbles upon an ancient tomb believed to be of Vrill origin, but this unleashes the first known zombie outbreak in history. Aiming to stop Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States of America send Takeo, Nikolai and Dempsey to capture Richtofen, the mastermind behind the advanced technology. By this time, Group 935's operatives have been wiped out, and Maxis himself was lobotomized when he began to turn into a zombie. The group put aside their nationalities to fight the undead, and are contacted by Samantha, begging to be freed from Agartha. Richtofen puts Maxis' brain in a flying drone, and he joins the fight against the zombies and to free Samantha. The group is eventually successful, and while Maxis meets his daughter, they enter Agartha to be rewarded. A cutscene is played of Samantha with a boy named Eddie, playing with toys of the characters who have appeared in the Zombies game mode throughout all three games. Air raid sirens are heard and the two children retreat to the basement with Maxis, with Samantha noting her father has a plan to make their games real. It is ambiguous as to whether the events of the game mode have actually occurred or has all along been simply in Samantha's imagination.","[19979, 19980, 19981]",Call of Duty: Black Ops II,call-of-duty-black-ops-ii,a4465c83-a3a1-f8f3-591d-18fb053d9dc4,644.0,[790],,"[1256, 1257, 1258, 1259, 1260, 154188, 154189, 154190, 154191, 154192, 154193, 154194]","[1, 2, 3, 4]","[1, 18, 39]",[26784],"[13277, 74144, 74145, 74146, 74299, 79137, 122502, 189125, 213310, 216651, 245195, 321541, 402455, 1304921, 1928804, 1929537, 1929663, 1930589, 1931640, 1932093, 1932359, 1935661, 1935814, 1937558, 1938485, 2162684, 2589099, 2589249, 2609319]","[233707, 233709, 233711, 233712, 233713, 233714, 233715, 233716, 233717, 233718]","[21448, 21836, 79643, 261420, 261421, 261422, 261423, 261424, 261425, 261426, 332467]",73.17235903417374,[21865],[726],[123],"[6, 9, 12, 41]",1340494990,1688753370,,19.0,,,"[3076, 25734]",1956.0,[13358],1352678400.0,,"[343, 545, 564, 622, 960, 979, 1006, 2031, 2033, 5647]","[20153, 20154, 20854, 21686]",,75.82147363473393,186.0,,"[68706, 68707, 68708, 68711, 138106, 138107]",1122,,Black Ops II is the first game in the Call of Duty franchise to feature future warfare technology and the first to present branching storylines driven by player choice as well as selecting weapons before starting story mode missions.

Using various objects such as floating bubbles and bellows, the candy must also be manipulated around obstacles to get to Om Nom's mouth.

Each level pack introduces new challenges. Levels are scored with a zero to three star rating, according to how many stars the player picked up, and a point score depending on the number of stars collected and the amount of time taken to complete the level.

The four play settings include Single Race (which can be set to head-on or suicide modes, having you race against one or three vehicles driving in the opposite direction), Season, Time Trial and Practice. A new 3D engine allows for visible damage and effects such as reflections and mud sticking to your car or truck. Speaking of vehicles, you select from a pool of ten with different ratings in power, top speed and weight.

You can also customize shocks, steering response, brakes, gearing ratios, transmission, tires (choose from all purpose, off-road, snow or slick) and even paint--both body and detail colors can be set to your liking. Yet the most notable addition is the track editor, which allows you to build your own course from scratch or modify an existing one to add more jumps, 90 degree turns, mud pits, and several other features. In total, there are 16 different track pieces you can position on an 8 x 8 grid using one of three themes: desert, snow or forest. Rally Cross 2 also supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller and up to two players for head-to-head competition.

A CIA agent named Sonia enters the place and asks for Ryu Hayabusa's whereabouts, until members of the Black Spider Ninja Clan attack the shop and kidnap her. Enter the Dragon Ninja Ryu, who fails to stop Sonia's kidnapping and makes haste around the Tokyo skyscrapers and rescues the agent, who informs him of an attack on the Hayabusa Village by the Black Spider Ninjas, who wish to steal the Demon Statue they possess and protect.

Ryu returns to his home and finds his father, Joe Hayabusa dueling with Genshin, leader of the Black Spider Ninja Clan. Unfortunately, the Demon Statue is taken away by Queen of the Greater Fiends and the Ruler of Blood, Elizébet, and Joe urges his son to retrieve the statue at all costs. Ryu travels around the world with Sonia, in pursuit of Elizébet and the Demon Statue, while encountering legions of Black Spider Ninjas, Fiends, and three other Greater Fiends: Alexei, the Graceful Ruler of Lightning; Volf, the Invincible Ruler of Storms; and Zedonius, the Malevolent Ruler of Flame.

Ryu tracks Elizébet down to South America, where she offers the Demon Statue to Infernal High Priest Dagra Dai, in order to resurrect the ancient Archfiend, Vazdah. Elizébet duels with Ryu and he defeats her, but Elizébet proclaims her return. An overlooking Genshin explains that the fiends are looking to resurrect the Archfiend who is supposed to emerge from Mount Fuji back in Japan. The mountain is also the place which bound both the Black Spider Clan and The Dragon Lineage. Ryu returns home, cautioning Sonia not to follow him.

As Ryu overlooks the fire-brimming Mount Fuji, Ayane enters with the Eye of the Dragon, a gift from Joe Hayabusa, and Ryu equips the relic onto his Dragon Sword, forming the True Dragon Sword again. Heading to the mountain's summit, Ryu finds Genshin waiting for him at the crater's entrance. As Mount Fuji erupts, Genshin reveals to Ryu that he never cared for ""tantrums of the archfiend"" and that their moment has finally arrived. The two ninjas fight to the death before Genshin falls dead and Ryu leaps into Mount Fuji. Elizébet appears over a deceased Genshin looking to revive him as a fiend as Ryu descends into Mount Fuji.

Ryu fights past hordes of Fiends and singlehandedly defeats Zedonius, Volf, and Alexei, and rescues a captured Sonia. He instructs her to stay put and to not move. Ryu heads into another room and finds a resurrected Genshin, transformed into a Fiend, back for a fourth and final battle. The two ninja battle in another arduous battle ending with Ryu eventually cutting Genshin down, even splitting his face armor doing so. Genshin and Ryu, though mortal adversaries, share a final mutual respect as ninja in Genshin's dying moment. Genshin shares with Ryu that all of his actions were meant to strengthen the Black Spider Clan as a whole (his cause all along) and has no regrets of pursuing that. He acknowledges Ryu as a great warrior, and in support of Ryu's cause hands him the cursed blade of the archfiend for use before dying. A furious Elizébet appears, and chastises the Black Spider Ninja for losing, even with his power. Ryu attacks Elizébet, and angrily cuts her down to red dust with the combination of his own dragon sword and Genshin's blade of the archfiend. He states that the overlord had more to live for than she ever would.

Traveling deeper into the Underworld, Ryu confronts Dagra Dai, who is nearly finished with the Archfiend's resurrection, and defeats him. As a last resort, the Infernal High Priest offers his life to Vazdah, and the Archfiend is reborn. Ryu takes down the monstrosity and heads to the surface with Sonia, but a drop of his blood from an open wound accidentally spills onto the fiend and revitalizes Vazdah, who ascends to the summit in its true form. Amidst an erupting Mount Fuji, Ryu squares off with the Archfiend in a climatic duel to decide humanity's fate and wins. Sonia and Ryu reunite and climb to the top of the mountain, sharing the sunrise together.

In a post-credits scene, amongst a field with countless number of blades embedded into the ground, Ryu plants Genshin's Blade of the Archfiend into the ground and bows in respect for the Black Spider Overlord. The Dragon Ninja takes one last look before taking off into the fog.

Awakened by the End of Days, Death, the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen, embarks upon a quest to restore mankind, and redeem his brother's name. Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation.

Darksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.

Like the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including 'The White city', an outpost where angels live, and 'The Eternal Throne', a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair."

In the year 22XX AD, a mysterious mineral known as Force Metal was extracted from the fragments of a meteor that landed in the Pacific Ocean. Technology based on the metal revolutionized the field of Reploid engineering. The Federation built Giga City, an artificial island, near the meteor site for the explicit purpose of mining and smelting Force Metal.

Everything seemed to go well, until a band of renegade Reploids armed themselves and launched a rebellion on the island. They banished all humans and demanded that the government recognize Giga City as an independent Reploid state. This new Rebellion Army and its leader, Epsilon, were all branded Mavericks for this deed.

After the first team of Maverick Hunters was annihilated or otherwise subdued by the Rebellion Army, Colonel Redips sent in a special team composed of X, Zero, and Shadow. If they failed their mission - arrest Epsilon and quell the Reploid insurrection - the Federation would have no choice but to declare all-out war on Giga City and the Rebellion Army.

Chapter 1: Infiltrate Giga City!
X, Zero, and Shadow teleport to the outskirts of Giga City to investigate an energy reading in the Lagrano Ruins. The trio are separated by a mysterious explosion, but they continue towards the top of the structure. X and Zero meet up near the top when they are suddenly attacked by Hippopressor, which they destroy.

Upon making it to the roof, X and Zero find Shadow faced with Epsilon. They begin to arrest Epsilon, but Shadow turns on them, revealing his true allegiance to the Rebellion Army. The Rebellion cadres - Scarface, Botos, and Ferham - also reveal themselves, and the Hunters realize that they've been led into an ambush. Zero attempts to strike Epsilon, but is overpowered and sent flying by the cadres attacks. Now alone, X finds himself with no other choice but to flee, leaping off the roof and into a chasm below. Ferham begins to give chase, but Epsilon stops her, well-aware that X will return.","[3219, 3220]",Mega Man X: Command Mission,mega-man-x-command-mission,90ce6696-abf5-1f47-a765-60d7453148cb,10.0,[47870],,"[431742, 431743, 431744, 431745, 431746, 431747, 431748, 431749, 431750]",[1],"[1, 18]","[10339, 10340, 10341, 10342, 10343, 10344, 10345]","[35117, 144664, 246623, 1747617]",,"[165010, 177425, 177427, 177428, 177429, 177430, 177431, 333842]",79.52024321369507,,[38],,"[8, 21]",1352060287,1688746911,,,,,[3337],338.0,,1091059200.0,,"[1877, 19164, 25300, 25311, 55038, 96217, 103301, 105269, 106987, 107318]",,,79.52024321369507,1.0,,"[238235, 238236, 238237, 238238, 238239, 238240]",1751,38.0,"Mega Man X: Command Mission, known as Rockman X Command Mission in Japan, is a spin-off game in the Mega Man X series. It was released in 2004 on both the PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo GameCube, making it the second-to-last game in the Mega Man X series to be released. Unique to the series, it is an RPG featuring turn-based combat and an extensive story. It plays quite similarly to Capcom's signature Breath of Fire series in a number of ways, due to the shared development team.

Mario Kart Wii retains the traditional item-based weaponry familiar with the franchise, where players can select a Mario franchise driver and themed vehicles. As with most racing games, the overarching goal is to place first among other competitors, through the usage of such items and taking the fastest routes to secure the leads. Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers. Game modes are also present such as the traditional Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial modes."

As Ai, a grade-schooler yet to realize how closed off she is, you are forced to play children’s games in a world of permanent dusk. There, Ai’s life hangs in the balance as you are attacked day after day by shadowy entities and eyeball monsters among other horrors. Eventually monsters start to bleed into the real world, where Ai discovers that she, too…

Test your courage in a dangerous game of hide and seek before initiating a terrifyingly twisted version of tag with abominations not of this world. Use the items you’ve gathered to flee your sunset hell, but be sure to remember the paths you’ve taken or risk being trapped there forever.

Experience an unnerving mix of beauty, fear and nostalgia in a mysterious world where a Japanese house, school and hospital are all inexplicably connected. Explore corridors dyed twilight crimson, witness the ethereal glow of amber through paper walls of a traditional Japanese house and escape creeping black shadows in hospital rooms where the power is somehow always out.

10-year-old Ai has no defensive measures to defeat the enemies you face; instead, you must take advantage of each spirit’s weaknesses to survive. Hold your breath to sneak past blind foes or dash past deaf ones as quick as your little legs can carry you. And if you can’t get away in time, prepare to suffer a dire fate at the hands of unimaginable forces.

Upon clearing the game, another ending will become available to you. What story will this new path unveil? Slipping back into the terrifying world of Yuoni will see you face considerably more challenging foes for an even greater reward.","[145165, 200191]",Yuoni,yuoni,76c479ca-59d3-6544-27c8-3317bce1bf4a,,"[53352, 53353]",,"[550305, 550306, 550307, 550308, 550309]",[1],"[1, 19, 21]",[45006],"[2003754, 2003788, 2010755, 2054053, 2085363, 2115723, 2658432]","[271428, 271430, 271432, 271433, 271435, 271437, 271439, 271440]","[202629, 211803, 211805, 246508, 455035]",,[206573],,,"[6, 48, 49, 167, 169]",1620309429,1688745878,,,,,[14456],,,1629331200.0,,"[11668, 25646, 26574, 26658, 68271, 96217, 105269, 107318, 109550, 111130]",,,,,,"[303101, 303102, 303103, 303104, 303105, 309028, 309029]",146806,,"Yuoni is a first-person narrative horror game that whisks you away to a sunset-stained world to play a deadly game of hide and seek.

It is the story of the New World Empire's attempt to defend Earth from an invasion of alien renegades, with inspiration coming from Sketch's oddly vivid dreams and nightmares. One night, while Sketch is working on Comix Zone during a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt strikes a panel of his comic. In this instant, its main villain, a powerful mutant named Mortus, escapes the comic book's pages, desiring to kill Sketch so he can become flesh and blood and take over the real world. Because he does not possess any power in reality, Mortus sends Sketch into the world of his own comic, freely drawing in enemies attempting to kill him.

Inside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is ""the chosen one"" who came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil of Mortus and the alien invaders. Ignoring Sketch's protests, Alissa sends him on his mission, keeping in touch with instructions and hints via radio. It is up to Sketch to stop Mortus's evil plans and find a way out of this comic world.

The game has two possible endings. At the end of the game, Alissa attempts to defuse a nuclear weapon that Mortus and the Mutants plan on using to wipe out the New World Empire and humanity, when Mortus comes back into the comic and throws her into the chamber, which starts to fill up with liquid. Mortus then battles Sketch personally. If the player defeats Mortus and the Kreeps he summons as he takes damage quickly enough to drain the liquid and save Alissa before the nuke self-destructs, an ending occurs where Alissa comes to the real world with Sketch and Roadkill and joins the army, eventually becoming Chief of Security for the United States. Roadkill is given a vast amount of mozzarella cheese, and spends a lot of time exploring the city's new sewer system when not sleeping under a pile of Sketch's dirty socks.

Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each ""movie"" is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives.

New technology dubbed ""the AI Director"" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie.

Addictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them."

You swiftly assemble a posse of outlaws, some with guns, others with the kind of supernatural skills that make saloon bars fall silent in a split second.

Night falls and the posse rides out, silhouetted in the spectral light of the moon. Together, you transform the prairie into an ungodly land echoing with gunfire and the screams of the hunted.

But once on board the train, you discover it’s not named the “Ghost Train” for nothing. What follows is the fight of your life through the uncharted badlands of the Hard West, propelled by bullets, witchcraft, and your pursuit of personal salvation at any cost.

You didn’t ask to lead this expedition but here you are: stuck in the ice, Captain missing, miles from civilization and everyone looking for you to lead. Manage your meager resources, balance safety and morale, make the hard calls and head in the only direction you can - into The Pale Beyond.

A polar exploration game set in an unforgiving frozen wasteland where you embark on a treacherous voyage across the ice and into the Pale Beyond. It’s a stunning yet harsh landscape that can change at any moment.

Every decision matters. As the expedition unfolds and the winter approaches, every decision you make will have a meaningful impact on the story as you navigate a way over the ice.

After the Captain mysteriously goes missing, you unwillingly take the position of Captain. You didn’t ask to lead this crew but here you are: stuck in the ice, miles from civilization and everyone looking for you to lead.

Keeping the crew and sled dogs safe, fed, and warm during an expedition is key for survival. Surviving the ice will matter little in the face of a mutiny, every vote will count. So keep the crew on your side.

Unlike other games in the franchise, Mario will run on his own. All you do is tap the screen to jump. The longer you tap, the higher the jump meaning that you can play the game with one hand.

In this game, Mario constantly moves forward through the courses while you use a variety of jumps to navigate. Mario will behave differently depending on the timing of your taps, so it's up to you to show off particularly smooth moves, gather coins, and reach the goal.

There are three different game modes to play. The first mode features challenging courses for you to complete while collecting coins. The second mode has you challenge the play data of other players to show who can beat a course with the most style to impress Toads into joining you. In the third mode, you get to create your own Mushroom Kingdom using the coins and Toads collected by playing the first two game modes."

Drakkhen is a role-playing game with a visual presentation that combines 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen.

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.

Hitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.

HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.

An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.

Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.

Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game."

Someone who was supposed to be there isn’t.
Someone who wasn’t supposed to be there is.

Someone who was alive last night is dead now.
And someone who is here right now isn’t alive.

So, there is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up.
But don’t give up.

Only you can stand up to this.","[212529, 212530]",Higurashi: When They Cry Hou - Ch.4 Himatsubushi,higurashi-when-they-cry-hou-ch-dot-4-himatsubushi,94310de3-fea4-146d-13e5-c47a9fe2d4ad,1.0,[88952],,"[47744, 47746, 1043305, 1043306]",[1],"[19, 43]",[40352],"[3107, 200943, 2068016, 2072786]","[482323, 482324]","[29995, 29996, 120371, 461492]",80.0,,,[219],"[3, 6, 14, 48, 130]",1495629563,1688735998,248194.0,,,,,1298.0,,1475798400.0,,"[13189, 18011, 25646, 26223, 26565, 27266, 55282, 80916, 81275, 111130]",,,80.0,,,"[472163, 472164, 472165, 472166, 472167]",31363,,"Higurashi When They Cry is a sound novel.

New Arkham City inmate and rising warlord, Two-Face devises a plan to publicly execute fellow prisoner Catwoman after she tries to steal back some of her ill-gotten gains from his hideout. Meanwhile, Gotham City itself has degenerated into a police state managed by Mayor Sharp, where citizens with the slightest trace of a criminal record find themselves shipped to the prison district. Those who dare to challenge Sharp's policies are the target of arranged disappearances, becoming political prisoners trapped behind Arkham's walls. Among these is Bruce Wayne, who holds a rally attacking the proposal of turning half his city into a walled-off reserve for criminally inclined persons. Segregated from society, he argues, they have become responsible for their own survival in an anarchic urban hell which is characterized by bloody gang wars.

Welcome to Arkham City
Wayne, as the latest focus of Sharp's vendetta, is kidnapped by TYGER Security operatives working for Hugo Strange, who is privy to his dual identity as Batman. Strange intends to unveil new plans for Arkham City before the night is up, an operation codenamed Protocol 10, which will establish himself as supreme ruler of Gotham. Now an inmate, the Dark Knight manages to have Alfred Pennyworth deliver his crimefighting equipment to him directly via an airdrop, and he prepares to save Catwoman from Two-Face for the sake of their past relationship while uncovering the true nature of Protocol 10.","[107029, 107030, 107031, 107032]",Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition,batman-arkham-city-game-of-the-year-edition,22e7d862-cba0-a219-efaa-e4a25f03b822,105.0,[32298],Batman: Arkham City - GOTY Edition,"[101907, 101908, 101909, 101910, 101911]",[1],"[1, 23, 38]",[30594],"[13324, 53550, 81459, 95173, 223837, 1929184, 1929547, 2069407, 2564940, 2627310]","[393706, 393708, 393710, 393712, 393714, 393716, 393718, 393720, 393722, 393723, 393724, 393725, 393726, 393727, 393728, 393729, 393730, 393731, 393732, 393733, 393734]","[26680, 120153, 151285, 151286, 151287, 151288, 151289, 151290, 151291, 151292, 151293, 161935]",93.52988579582387,[20834],[5],[6],"[6, 9, 12, 14]",1469795614,1688735944,,1.0,501.0,,,68.0,,1338249600.0,,"[19564, 19565, 26574, 76253, 81249, 103054, 103168, 103303, 115283, 118218]",,,93.76494289791194,20.0,,"[208747, 208748, 208749, 301227]",21704,5.0,"Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition includes the following DLC:

Nine months after the |Joker's death, crime rates in Gotham City have dramatically declined, but Batman anticipates a new threat and maintains a vigil over the city. Before his death, the Joker sent his mutated blood to Gotham's hospitals, and several patients were infected. While most were cured, the patients who were not treated are starting to look and act like the Joker. Batman researches a cure for the mutations, and orders Robin to watch over the infected.

The Arkham Knight
On Halloween night, Scarecrow unleashes his newest strain of Fear Gas in a diner, and threatens to release it throughout Gotham. Six million civilians are evacuated, but the city's criminals and supervillains stay behind, leaving Commissioner James Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department outnumbered. Batman investigates Scarecrow's presence, and searches for him in a rooftop safehouse, but instead finds and saves Poison Ivy, who was being held captive by Scarecrow's henchmen. In a makeshift Batcave in Gotham's Clock Tower, Barbara Gordon is collecting information on Scarecrow's new toxin, and traces its production to Ace Chemicals. Batman goes to investigate, but is confronted by the mysterious ""Arkham Knight"" and his militia, which has a massive army of unmaned tanks. Batman fights his way through the militia, learning from workers that Scarecrow is planning to produce a chemical explosion so large that it will cover the entire eastern seaboard in fear toxin. Batman reaches Scarecrow, who reveals to him that Barbara has been abducted by the Arkhan Knight before escaping. While reducing the blast radius, Batman is exposed to the fear toxin, which reacts with his own mutated blood to cause hallucinations of the Joker. Escaping from the exploding Ace Chemicals, Batman is forced to tell Gordon about his daughter's involvement in his crime-fighting, and the outraged Gordon swears that he will find Barbara without Batman's help.

Scarecrow's Plans
Batman tracks the Arkham Knight to an underground tunnel network, hoping to learn Barbara's whereabouts from him, but instead gets ambushed by him. Batman then gives chase to the escaping convoy, only to learn that the driver is a decoy, using a voice synthesizer that makes him sound like the Arkham Knight. Batman interrogates the driver and learns that they are heading to the North Refrigeration. He and Nightwing interrogate the Penguin, who tells them that the Knight and Scarecrow are meeting with a businessman named Simon Stagg, who runs a pharmaceutical company. After boarding Stagg's airship, Batman discovers that Scarecrow paid Stagg to create a device known as the ""Cloudburst"", but Stagg tried to double-cross them and has been doused with fear toxin as punishment. After reaching Scarecrow and interrogating Stagg, Batman is again exposed to the toxin, which triggers a powerful hallucinogenic response. Scarecrow escapes with the Cloudburst. Batman receives a message from Scarecrow revealing that Barbara is in the same safehouse where Ivy was held, but before Batman can save her, Barbara is doused with fear toxin and shoots herself in the head. Batman and Alfred Pennyworth are devastated, but Alfred convinces Batman to not lose hope, for Barbara's sake. Alfred explains to Batman that the Cloudburst is a dispersal device designed to flood all of Gotham with the fear toxin. To counteract this effect, Batman enlists the help of Ivy, who takes control of a large tree which develops giant flowers capable of neutralizing the toxin.","[107154, 107155, 107156]",Batman: Arkham Knight - Premium Edition,batman-arkham-knight-premium-edition,646afaef-0ca9-443c-f36b-0aab83bb106a,,"[40059, 40060]",Premium Edition,"[349983, 349984, 349985, 397951, 397952]",[1],"[1, 20, 23, 38]","[46777, 46779]","[81472, 95180, 2071086, 2083350, 2593565]","[481678, 481679, 481680, 481681, 481682, 481683, 481684, 481685, 481686, 481687, 481688, 481689, 481690, 481691, 481692, 481693, 481694]","[151440, 151441, 151442, 151443, 151444, 151445, 151446, 151447, 151448, 151449, 161940]",,,[5],[6],"[6, 48, 49]",1501341368,1688735872,,,5503.0,,[20193],68.0,,1435017600.0,,"[19564, 19565, 26574, 55984, 76253, 81249, 103054, 103168, 103303, 107614]",,,,1.0,1.0,"[208993, 208994, 208995]",52440,5.0,"Includes the main game and the season pass.
